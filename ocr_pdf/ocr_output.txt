V2 Consider the string matching problem of finding all occurrences of pattern P =
abcab in the text T = aaabcabad, where £ = {a@; 5; ¢ ; d}. Give the prefix
function 7 for the pattern P, bad character function A for the pattern P and alphabet
= and good suffix function y for the pattern P, Using the Boyer-Moore algorithm
how far is the pattern shifted after the first character mismatch ?
