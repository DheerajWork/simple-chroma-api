Rise of British Rule in India

Since the ancient period, India has enjoyed an incomparable position in the whole world due to its economic,
cultural and religious inheritance. Due to the economic prosperity and cultural inheritance, people from different
nations of the world came to India. There was a lot of demand for the Indian spices, muslin, silk cloth, indigo etc
in the European countries. Trade between India and Europe was carried out through land route and sea route
and at the centre of these routes was Istanbul (Constantinople) in Turkey.

After the conquest of Constantinople in 1453 A.D. by Turkish Muslims, the sea route through Constantinople
(Istanbul) was closed for the Europeans. Since they could not do without the spices, the Europeans felt
compelled to discover a new sea route. So an era of geographical discoveries began.

Discovery of sea route to India

With the inspiration, encouragement and economic help from the Portuguese King Prince Henry, some
brave people began efforts to discover new sea route. Many great men tried to discover sea route to India
namely Bartholomew Diaz who discovered the “Cape of Good Hope’. With the economic assistance from the
King of Spain, Christopher Columbus began his adventure of discovering a new sea route, which again came to
a stop at an island, presently known as West Indies, situated in the Atlantic Ocean. Columbus, who had believed
through out his life that he had discovered a new sea route to India, had actually discovered a new land. Since
this clarification was made by Amerigo Vespucci, this new land began to be known as ‘America’.

1.1 Sea Route to India

The Portuguese sailor Vasco-da-Gama discovered the sea route to India in 1498 A.D. When he reached
Calicut in the western coast of India, he was welcomed by the then King Zamorin and allowed to carry out
business there. Thus, this is considered as an important event in the world as this opened the doors for other
Europeans to come to India.

Arrival of Europeans to India (Arrival of the British and establishment of trade centres)

The Portuguese were the first to arrive in India for trade after the discovery of the sea route to India.
Within a span of a hundred years, the Portuguese took control of several territories like Diu, Daman, Goa,
Cochin, Malacca etc. Inspired by the Portuguese success in trade, the Dutch(from Holland) and the Danish
(from Denmark) arrived in India for trade. The English traders established the East India Company to carry out
trade with India. In 1600 A.D., when Queen Elizabeth of England gave the permission to the East India
Company to carry out trade with the eastern countries, the first ship, under the leadership of Captain William
Hawkins arrived in Surat. But due to the dominance and opposition from the Portuguese, they were not allowed
to establish their trade there. But finally, the East India Company got the permission from the Mughal Emperor

Jehangir and thus the British East India Company established its first trade centre (Kothi) in Surat in 1613 A.D.
Initially, the Company established its trade centres in Surat, Bharuch and Ahmedabad.

But due to the strong presence of the Marathas in this region, the Company sensed danger to its existence
and hence moved towards the south and east directions where they set up their centres in Machlipattanam
(Andhra Pradesh), Saint George (Chennai) and Fort William (Kolkata). Mumbai became their headquarter
in 1687 A.D.

The French East India Company arrived in India for trade in 1668 A.D. and eventually set up their trade
centres in Mahe, Karaickal, Pondicherry (Puducherry), Chandranagar, Machlipattanam etc. In the 18" century,
the English and the French were constantly busy establishing their rule in the entire world and conquering more
territories. Between 1746 and 1763, there were three Mysore Wars between the French East India Company
and the British East India Company in India which the French East India Company lost, thus, making easy, the
expansion of the British East India Company. Thus, at the end of this battle for power, the Portuguese were left

with Diu, Daman, Goa, while French had their trade centres at Chandranagar, Mahe, Karaickal and Pondicherry.
Meanwhile, the Dutch had to leave forever.
Battle of Plassey

Siraj-ud-Daula was ruling over Bengal. Due to his impulsive nature, he had some opponents in his state.
During this period, the British East India Company built a fortress around the trade centre in Kolkata on pretext
of security reasons, without taking the permission of the Nawab. But Nawab Siraj-ud-Daula destroyed the
fortress. When this news reached Madras (Chennai), a small army of the Company, lead by Robert Clive,
reached Bengal in order to help the Kolkata trade centre.

In spite of the army of the East India Company being strong, they realised that it was not easy to defeat the
Nawab’s army. So Robert Clive resorted to treachery. A conspiracy was planned in order to defeat the Nawab,
in which the Nawab’s commander-in-chief Mir Jafar and Seth Amichand were coaxed to join. On the pretext
that the Nawab is unnecessarily harassing the people, a war was declared at a ground near a village named
Plassey.

@ The Battle of Plassey was fought on 23% June, 1757 A.D..

e@ The battlefield of Plassey is situated 38 km from Murshidabad(West Bengal).

According to the plan, Mir Jafar lost the battle. Siraj-ud-Daula was defeated. Due to Robert
Clive’s treachery, the Battle of Plassey ended in just half a day. The Company, as a result, got a frechold over
24 Parganas. Mir Jafar was made the Nawab of Bengal. Thus, the foundation of the Company’s rule in India
was laid with the Battle of Plassey in 1757.

Battle of Buxar

The Britishers made Mir Jafar, the Nawab of Bengal and under different pretexts, tried to extract plenty of
wealth from him. Due to their greed to gain more powers, the East India Company managed to dethrone
Mir Jafar and made Mir Qasim, the Nawab of Bengal. Mir Qasim proved to be more ambitious than Mir Jafar
and thus became a threat for the Company. Hence, Mir Qasim was removed and Mir Jafar was again made the
Nawab. Mir Qasim took refuge with the Nawab of Awadh. During this time, the Mughal emperor
ShahAlam had come to Awadh. So, all three of them decided to join hands and fight the Company unitedly
and thus declared a war.

At Buxar, the East India Company fought against the united
army (22" October, 1764), in which the united army lost. Thus the
Company got the Diwani rights (right to collect revenue) to Bengal,
Bihar and Orissa.

Expansion of the Company Rule

The English government passed a regulating act in 1773 A.D.
according to which the Governor of Bengal was made the Gover-
nor General and all the trade and political activities of the Company
were brought under his direct control. The Mumbai-Madras Gover-
nor and his council were brought under him. Thus, Warren Hastings

Governor General Warren Hastings

became the first Governor General of India. During his tenure, the
First Maratha War and the Second Mysore War with Haider Ali of
Mysore, was waged. The problems for the East India Company
increased because it had to face both the powers simultaneously.

Cornwallis took over as Governor General after Warren Hastings.
During the tenure of Cornwallis, the Third Mysore War took place
with Tipu Sultan, famously known as the Tiger of Mysore. The Com-
pany had to join hands with the Marathas and the Nizam to defeat the
Tipu Sultan. Tipu could not win against the combined forces and had to
accept the treaty.

--- PAGE 4 ---
After Cornwallis, Sir John Shore became the Governor General. Due to some rigid policies adopted by him,
the East India Company’s fame declined and Marathas became stronger. So Governor General Wellesley, who
came after John Shore, got the responsibility of making the Company supreme in India. For this, Wellesley
introduced the Subsidiary Alliance System. The conditions of the System and the states adopted under this are
as follows :

Terms and Conditions of Subsidiary Alliance System
The army trained by the East India Company Government will be provided to the state that

accepts the System.

In return, the state accepting the System will provide for the army or give away

provinces with equivalent income to the British.

Without the permission of the Company, the state will not wage war or sign treaty
with other states.
There will be one English representative in the state assembly.

Other foreigners not to be employed in the state.

1.5 Wellesley and Subsidiary Alliance System

This System was like “sweet poison”. By implementing this System, Wellesley annexed many provinces
and expanded the rule of the East India Company. Governor General Wellesley asked Tipu Sultan to accept
the Subsidiary Alliance System, which he refused. For declining the Alliance System, the Company, with
support from the Nizam, attacked Mysore in 1799. During this Fourth Mysore War, Tipu lost his life while
fighting against the British.

After Wellesley, Hastings came to India as Governor General. He waged a war with Nepal and made the

Gurkhas to join the army. Hastings fought a battle with the Pindharas and took control over them. With the Third
Maratha War, the supremacy of the Company was established.

In comparison to the earlier Governor Generals, William Bentinck is known as a “liberal Governor Gen-
eral”. Bentinck believed that the dissatisfaction in different states due to the imperialist policy adopted by the
previous Governor Generals could not bring about any unity. So he was very liberal in his deeds.

Dalhousie came to India as the Governor General in 1848. He was a fierce imperialist. Dalhousie adopted
the Policy of Annexation for the expansion of the Company and British imperialism in India.

Besides being an imperialist, Dalhousie was also a reformist. The first railway line in India (between
Mumbai-Thane, 1853 A.D.),wireless system between India and England, establishment of public works
department, English education etc. were all introduced during his tenure. He passed laws to ban child marriage
and advocated widow remarriage.

Within 100 years, from the Battle of Plassey in 1757, the British rule and the empire, both expanded. But,
in the process, they had to face the dissatisfaction of the Indian states and this was manifested in the form of the
first struggle for independence in 1857 A.D.

Economic impact of the Company

When we evaluate the 100 years of Company rule in India, we realise that, India, which had an enviable
position in the world in the previous centuries, became merely a country that produces raw material for England
and a prospective market for goods produced in factories. Bengal exported cotton cloth, raw silk, sugar, jute,
muslin (1708 to 1756), but after the Dual Power Policy, the glitter of the economic prosperity of Bengal faded.
[The Dual Power Policy (Dwimukhi Shasan) was introduced for the first time in Bengal whereby the power of
collecting revenue was with the British while the responsibility of people’s welfare was with the Nawab. Thus,
the British got the power without any responsibility and the Nawab had the responsibility without any power.
This was known as the Subsidiary Alliance System which ruined Bengal economically]

The unfair revenue collection policy by the Company made the Indian peasant a debtor. The British
government imposed unfair taxes on the Indian cloth industries. They adopted various deceitful practices to ruin
the prosperous Indian industries, because of which it completely collapsed. The Indian artisan became poor and

C1 Rise of British Rule in India


--- PAGE 6 ---
unemployed. The Company traders forced the weavers of Bengal to sign contracts for providing definite
quantity of cloth in a short period. If the weaver refused, he would be punished by being lashed or jailed.

Before the arrival of the Company, the Indian villages were self-reliant and prosperous. But under the
Company rule, they became dependent and poor.

During the rule of the East India Company, the first railway line between Mumbai and Thane and steamer
service between India and England was started and development of the ports in Mumbai, Madras(Chennai) and
Kolkata also took place.

Social impact of the Company Rule

During the British administration, the spirit of freedom of speech and thought developed among people due
to the development of newspapers. In the Indian society, certain wrong social customs, rites and rituals were
prevalent during this time like Sati System, female infanticide, child marriage etc. Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Durgaram
Mehta, Behramji Malbari etc. were the stalwarts whose role was instrumental in getting the laws passed with
the help of Britishers. As the administrative framework in India was anglicised, there was a demand for people
with knowledge of English. English education began to be imparted in India due to Lord Macaulay’s endeavours.
As recommended by Charles Wood, universities were established in Mumbai, Madras and Kolkata.

A whole class of people with knowledge of English developed because of English education. With the
passage of time, this group made demands for social reforms and gave momentum to the process of reforms.

Conclusion

Thus, the East India Company came to India being allured by the prosperity and trade opportunity. The
Company rule in India produced certain good and bad results in the political, economic, social and cultural fields.
The Company adopted the policy of making England prosperous at the cost of India and the reforms they made

in the administration, for their own interest, indirectly proved to be beneficial for India.

First World War and Russian Revolution

The yearning of the western European countries for expansion of the empire and acquire new territories
(colonies) resulted in these countries going to Asia and Africa. Thus they established their colonies and ex-
panded their rule. Consequently, there arose a competition between European nations to establish colonies.

This greed for colonisation among the western European nations caused the economic, social and cultural
ruin of the Asian-African countries. The result of this on world politics was such that the First World War,
Bolshevik Revolution etc. took place.

So dear students, let’s study about these details.
Western Europe and Colonialism in Asia-Africa

The western European countries wanted to expand their empire in Asia-Africa. Their greed for colonisation
did not spare even their neighbouring countries. Spain had taken control over Netherland, Belgium and Luxem-
burg. Later on, some of their provinces were captured by France. When the Portuguese king died without an
heir, Portugal came under the rule of the Spanish king because of his blood relation. So for six decades, the
monopoly of establishing colonies in non-European countries was with Spain.

Similarly, Italy and German states became the victim of the greed of France and Austria. When the
European powers were tightening their grip over the Asian and African nations, many of the European nations
which had become free, following the footsteps of England, made many of the Afro-Asian nations their colonies.

Colonialism in Asia : After strengthening its grip over India, England expanded its empire to Sri Lanka,
Myanmar (Burma), Singapore and Malaysia. England entered China also. But due to the opium trade between
England and China, there were wars (1839-1842) which came to be known as Opium Wars in history. China lost
this war and thereby lost five of its ports to England where England could carry on their trade and thus expanded
their empire. Taking advantage of China’s weakness, Japan, Russia, Germany, France, Belgtum and America
also acquired trade and political rights.

Enormous oil resources in the desert region of West Asia attracted the Europeans to establish colo-
nies there. England, Germany, Russia and America established oil companies in Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi
Arabia and Bahrain and made efforts to take care of their own interests.

Colonialism in Africa : The Dutch established its colony for the first time at the end of 15" century in
South Africa. After that, England and France established their colonies in Cape and Algeria in North Africa
respectively. The vast provinces of Africa seemed quite suitable for acquiring raw material and selling ready
products post Industrial Revolution, because of which European countries competed to establish colonies. King
Leopold of Belgium seized the vast provinces of Congo and established his rule. England established its colonies
in Egypt, some provinces of East Africa and some of South Africa. France established its colonies in Tunisia,
Morocco and West Africa provinces. Germany established its empire in some provinces of East and West
Africa. Italy captured the African provinces around the Red Sea. Spain and Portugal also seized some provinces
of Africa. A conference for the European nations was held in Berlin (1884-85) in the midst of this competition to
establish colonies. Different African territories were divided among the European nations at the end of the
conference. Thus the colonial dominance of different European nations was established over the entire Africa.

While on one hand, the greedy European nations were trying to colonise various Asian- African territories,
on the other hand, Germany and Italy had completed the process of its respective political unification. Thus, the
unified Germany plunged into the competition of industrialisation, commercialisation and colonisation. Thus,
these quickly changing global phenomena had exploited some of these countries politically, economically and
socially due to which their development had stopped. This had lead to the First World War.

Factors that caused First World War

The First World War could be considered as one of the most heartbreaking and unforgettable events of the
modern world. Many factors were responsible for this. The First World War began on 1“ August, 1914.
Germany had defeated France in the Sedan War because of which France had to sign the Frankfurt Treaty(1871)
according to which France had to pay a war fine as well as give away two of its provinces, Lawrence and
Abscess, to Germany. France had not been able to overcome this humiliation. Thus, the Frankfurt Treaty itself
was the cause of the First World War. The end of a war sowed the seeds of a future war.

(1) Economic Factors : England had established its vast empire in Asia and Africa in the 19" century. It
exploited its colonies economically and became rich. Due to industrialisation and swift colonisation, Europe
required huge quantity of raw material. In the last quarter of the 19" century, Germany had started the competition
to procure the markets in Asia and Africa. Germany started supplying cheaper goods in comparison to England
and France. The Afro-Asian markets that England and France dominated, were thus, broken up by Germany.
Consequently, there was an intense economic competition between Germany and England.

(2) Militarism : Military force was necessary and important for the competition that the European
nations got into, for expansion. England, France, Austria, Russia etc. had begun expanding their military power.
While in countries like Japan, Italy and Germany, compulsory military training had started. Production of weapons
was increased under the pretext of self-defence. Thus, militarism got an impetus and military competition added
to economic competition created a serious atmosphere of war.

(3) Groupism — Secret Treaties : Groupism and secret treaties played a major role in the First World
War. The world was divided into two groups before the First World War. On one side was the group of Germany,
Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey while on the other side was the group of England, France, Russia and
Japan. A feeling of jealousy, enmity, mistrust, fear and hatred evolved between the groups which was an important
factor of the First World War.

(4) Feeling of Fierce Nationalism : The independence of Belgium and Greece and the unification of
Germany and Italy were the result of nationalism. But later, the feeling of nationalism took an extreme and
narrow form in Europe. Economic jealousies, competitions and colonialism in Europe had increased so much that
the national interest of each other began to clash. Leading European nations began teaching extreme and
destructive nationalism to its people. Love for own nation and hatred for the other nations was encouraged. The
German Chief Kaizer William was the other originator of nationalism and colonialism. He was overambitious
and believed in ‘world leadership’. He wanted to get things done according to his will with the help of his grand
military power. The feeling of war spread across other nations, as in Germany, and this had resulted in the First
World War.

(5) Role of Newspapers : The newspapers of the European nations aroused so much of hatred among
people with their mutual, derogatory, provocative, exaggerated and false write ups by spitting venom against
rival nations that the rulers of the respective nations could not even make efforts for establishing peace and
harmony.

(6) Philosophy about War : The policy of “War is Welfare” took root in Europe. The German writer
Trotsky published maxims like “Only the mighty deserve to live” and “War alone is the national need’. Nietzsche,

the German writer, expressed war as “a sacred work”.

The Prince of Austria and his wife were assassinated by being shot at by a member of the Serbian terrorist
organisation “Black Hand”. Austria blamed Serbia for the involvement in the act and gave an ultimatum to hand
over the culprit to Austria within 48 hours. Serbia declared its ignorance in the matter. Without listening to
anything from Serbia, Austria declared war on Serbia. The First World War had begun with this.

First World War and Russian Revolution


--- PAGE 10 ---
The First World War

In the First World War, 24 nations supported the Allied Nations and 4 nations supported the Axis Nations.
Initially, Germany made noteworthy victories in Europe. It ruined the French army. It fought many submarine
wars and destroyed the ships of the Allied Nations. Many soldiers and civilians died because of tanks and
poisonous gases. In 1917, the Russian Revolution started, so Russia withdrew from the war. Germany was very
strong at this time. It managed to drown an American steamer ‘Lusitania’ in which 147 American soldiers died.
Consequently, America joined the Allied Nations for the war in April, 1917. With that, countries like Panama,
Greece, Cuba, China and Siam joined the Allied Nations. Thus the Allied Nations became stronger. German
army could not withstand the American troops. The whole position of the war changed. Bulgaria in September,
1918, Turkey and Austria in October, 1918 joined the Allied Nations. The German leader Kaizer abdicated his
position and ran away. Germany surrendered to Allied Nations and signed a ceasefire treaty and the war came
to an end.

Effects of First World War - Immediate effects

(1) Destruction of men and material ; Approximately 6.5 crore people took part in the war, atleast 1
crore died, about 2 crore were injured and around 70 lakhs were rendered permanently handicapped. More
number of people died because of starvation and other forms of killings and epidemics that broke out after the

war. The total war expenditure was quite high.

(2) Social Change : During the war, since majority of the men, of all nations, were on the warfront,
women shouldered the responsibility of the family and occupation. They stepped out of their homes and successfully
took over the responsibility in the different professional fields. The self-confidence of their being equivalent to
men, enhanced. Consequently, the demand, for women to exercise their franchise, was raised. During the war,
the production of things of basic necessity had reduced. So problems like scarcity, unemployment, starvation,
strikes, lockouts etc. raised its head. People suffered a lot and children’s condition was pathetic.

(3) The Treaty of Versailles (June, 1919) : At the end of the First World War, the unconditional surrender
of Germany in front of the Allied Nations, brought an end to the war. Then, the Allied Nations undertook the
“Peace Process” in Paris, in which, some 58 commissions were formed and 145 sessions were organised. The
agreement made with Germany during the Paris Peace Process, was made in the Mirror Palace at Versailles.
Thus it came to be known as the Versailles Treaty. There were four provisions in the Treaty of Versailles: (1)
Regional arrangement (2) Reduction in troops and disarmament (3) The arrangement of distribution of gains at
the end of the war and war fine (4) Other provisions. The American President Woodrow Wilson, British Prime
Minister Lord George, French President Clemenco and Italian President Orlando played an important role in this
Treaty. Germany was found responsible for the war. A war fine of 6.5 billion pound was imposed on Germany.
It had to give away the Ruhr region to France. Its Rhine river had to be opened for international sea route. The
Rhineland region on French border was disallowed from being a fortress as well as this mineral-rich region was
given away to France for 15 years. Most of the German organisations were confiscated. Alsac and Lorraine
were to be returned to France. Besides this, Germany was to give to France and other Allied Nations, a large
quantity of coal and iron, annually, as the benefits of war. Germany was made to sign these terms and conditions
on gunpoint and forcibly because of which there was bitterness and desperation amongst Germans. Consequently,
the German economy failed miserably.

(4) Long term effects : There was a feeling of revenge in signing the Treaty with the nations that were
defeated in the war. Peace could not be established with the Treaty. Socialist Russia was not given a place in the
League of Nations. America did not join the League of Nations. That’s why, it can be said that, the reason for the
Second World War was in the Peace Process of the First World War itself,

The Russian/Bolshevik Revolution (1917)

The Russian Revolution (1917) is considered as an important event in world history. The Russians had been
oppressed and suppressed by the Czar (tsar) of Russia. The Russian Czars, who inherited the position, were all
dictators and enjoyed uncontrolled rule over people. People did not have any rights during this period. The Czars
were so cruel and pitiless on people that if anyone demanded for any rights, he was tortured, suppressed and
severely punished or condemned to be sent to the bone-chilling and dead cold of Siberia. This uncontrolled and
oppressive Czardom, became the reason for grief, poverty and suffering among people. The Russian farmers,
labourers and peasants were not getting enough income, despite working very hard. They became very poor.

Under the leadership of Father Gapon, a large rally was taken out to the Czar’s residence, Winter
Palace (22™ January, 1905, Sunday). These people were unarmed, while some had the Czar’s picture in hand
with captions like “Long live, the little white lord of Russia” written on it. The Czar’s army opened fire on these
innocent people, because of which thousands of innocent people died and the snow in Petersburg, where the
Czar’s palace was situated, turned red with blood. This day is known as “Bloody Sunday” in history. Around this
time, a large number of Russians got provoked and became restless as the weaknesses of the Czardom had
become obvious when a small nation like Japan had defeated a massive nation like Russia in the Russia-Japan
war (1904-05). In order to pacify the angry Russians, an announcement to call for a Duma Legislative Assem-
bly, which had not been called for years, was made. Eventually, four such Duma were called. But before it can
take steps to satisfy the citizens, it had been called off.

On 8" March, 1917, the oppressed workers of Petrograd called for a strike. The Czar sent his
troops to contain this event. But the army refused to shoot these people. As a result, the revolution began. After
the fall of the Czardom, the power fell into the hands of Karensky lead Menshevik group (Minority). Except for
Lenin, everyone in Russia was happy with the fall of the Czar. But Lenin believed in the importance of labourers
as propagated by Karl Marx, while the Menshevik group believed in the importance of the middle class. As a
result, Lenin instigated the Bolsheviks against Mensheviks and in November, 1917, declared the final revolution
and got the reins in his hands. This came to be known as the Socialist Bolshevik Revolution.

Thus, the 300years old Czardom came to an end and for the first time, Russia was without a Czar.
Efforts for World Peace
The League of Nations

The horrors of the World War explained the absolute necessity of world peace to the nations of the world.
And for this, a need for an international organisation was felt. So it became necessary to think actively and
immediately about world peace. The American President Woodrow Wilson had contributed substantially in the
establishment of the League of Nations. The 14 points suggested by Woodrow Wilson were presented during the
“Paris Peace Process” on 10° January, 1920. The League of Nations was formed.

Aims of the League of Nations
(1) To maintain international peace and security.
(2) Every nation to respect the unity and integrity of other nations.
(3) To give up the policy of war.
(4) To develop international relations.
(5) To solve international disputes peacefully, through negotiation or mediation.
(6) If any nation ignores the League of Nations or its mediations, it would be declared as a ‘rebel’ nation.

The League of Nations, established for world peace, did not manage to keep a control over the imperialist
policies of the superpowers and in 1939, the Second World War began.

Movement Towards A New World

Global Trends between the two World Wars

After the First World War, people became economically poor. The immediate governments in power were
unsuccessful in improving this condition. People lost trust in democracy. Dictatorship began in some countries,
which became a driving force for the Second World War. Let’s study the following series of events in this
respect.

(1) Fascism in Italy (2) Nazism in Germany (3) Militarism in Japan (4) Global Depression 1929-32

(1) Fascism in Italy : In the First World War, Italy was on the side of the winning nations and fought
for those nations. It incurred a massive expenditure of 12 billion dollars, lost lives of 6 lakh soldiers. Yet
the other winning nations took over the choicest territories, ignoring Italy. Italy was angry and frustrated.
Its nationalistic feeling was hurt for which Italians considered its government responsible and was more than
eager to avenge this national humiliation as soon as possible. In order to salvage Italy from such a dire situation,
Benito Mussolini launched the Fascist Party. He adopted “a bundle of sticks and axe”’(a symbol of supremacy
of the Roman emperor) as the symbol of his party. Fascism has evolved from the Italian word ‘fascege’
which means absolute control of the state on all things. Mussolini’s maxim was ‘One party, one leader’.
He gave military training to his party volunteers, who wore black uniform. After coming to power, Mussolini
captured Rhodes and Dodecanese islands from Turkey. He also won Albania, Abyssinia and Fume port in
1924. After these victories, Mussolini snapped all ties with the League of Nations and joined the “Rome
— Berlin — Tokyo” Axis. Thus, Italy became responsible for the Second World War.

(2) Nazism in Germany : Germany had lost the First World War. It was economically ruined. Paris
Peace Process had compelled Germany to sign the Treaty of Versailles. Germans were extremely angry
with this unjust treaty. Adolf Hitler joined the National Socialist German Workers Party in 1919. This party
came to be known as the Nazi Party. The Nazi philosophy included nationalism and socialism. After the
death of the German President Hindenburg, Hitler assumed the post and established his dictatorial rule. He
adopted stern and aggressive policies and led the Germans towards narrow nationalism. Germans considered
Hitler as ‘Fuhrer’ (Saviour).

Nazi soldiers wore blue military uniform and stuck a red strip on their shoulder and wore a symbol of
swastika ®. Hitler’s authoritarian and militarist nature became obvious after coming to power. His main aim was
the emergence of Germany as a major power. In the name of purification of the German race, his policies were
targeted at exterminating Jews, gypsies and mentally challenged people. By the end of the Second World War,
innumerable European Jews lost lives, which is known as the ‘Holocaust’ (genocide). Hitler’s expansionism,
military action against neighbouring countries and the policy of exterminating certain groups led to the Second
World War and became an important reason for the same.

(3) Militarism in Japan : According to the Treaty of Versailles(1919), Japan got the benefit of the
provinces of China. England and France distributed many regions of Germany between them. Japan was
quite displeased with this. In the 1921-22 Washington Meet, Japan had to agree to have only 35% of the
English and American naval force. Japan also had to vacate the islands of Sakhalin and Siberia. The Japanese
youth was angry at this. During this time, there were elections in Japan and the parties supporting Militarism
got the majority. The Military Nationalism of Japan adopted the policy of expansionism. Japan did not get
a permanent place in the League of Nations. The western countries could not stop the imperialist activities
of Japan. Japan captured Manchuria and established Manchukuo government (1932). Also, it captured Korea,
Mongolia, Shantung and some provinces of China. It improved its relation with Germany and Italy and let

loose, its string of imperialism. After Emperor Meiji, Emperor Hirohito (1936) also encouraged these activities
of Japan. Thus, Japan snapped all its ties with the League of Nations (1933).

(4) Global Depression 1929-32 : The heads of most of the European nations had the belief

that, with the end of the First World War, even the post-war problems of the world will come to an end. But this
proved wrong. Suddenly, a large number of shares began to be sold in the ‘Wall street’ stock market causing the
stock market to crumble. This was called as the “Wall street crisis’ by the critics (24" October, 1929). This crisis
shook the whole world and shattered the economic condition of the nations, giving birth to the Great Global
Depression. Most of the nations of the world were affected by this. Even a superpower like Great Britain had to
sacrifice its policy of keeping gold reserve against its currency ‘pound’. This affected the other nations of the
world and international trade and industry. Prosperous nations like America also had to impose strict measures.
Global trade was reduced to half. Thus, World War II started getting its outline.

World War IT (1939-1945) — Factors

The seed for the World War II had been sown in the Treaty of Versailles. Paris Peace Process had
displeased many nations. The events that happened after that, lead to the World War II.

So dear children, let’s study the factors responsible for World War IL.
Causes of World War II

(1) Fierce Nationalism : After the First World War, fierce nationalism developed in Germany, Japan
and Italy. Germans could never forget and overcome the Treaty of Versailles. Consequently, Hitler captured
some provinces of Austria and Czechoslovakia, following his Nazi philosophy that Germans must get all those
provinces where Germans were staying. Italy could not forget that it was ignored in the Treaty of Versailles.
Under the leadership of the Fascist Party, Mussolini started this fierce nationalism and adopted imperialist
policies. On the other hand, Japan too, gave in to imperialism. Thus, world peace was in danger.

(2) Groupism : Since France was always afraid of Germany after the First World War, it entered
into a treaty with Belgium, Poland, Romania and Czechoslovakia.

e Italy signed treaty with Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Romania, Hungary, Greece, Turkey and Austria.
e Russia signed treaty with Germany, Turkey, Lithuania and Iran.
e Italy formed the ‘“Rome-Berlin-Tokyo” Axis Group with the support of Germany and Japan.

e@ England and France formed another group with democratic values. Germany signed a non-aggression
treaty with Russia.

Thus, a whole atmosphere of fear spread in the whole world. This factor, too, gave an impetus to the
world war.

(3) Militarism : On one side, efforts were being made to maintain peace after the First World War,
whereas, on the other side, European nations were competing for ammunition. The production of more and
more weapons increased in all European nations. War weapons better than the others were being
manufactured. Some nations like Russia and Germany began compulsory military training. All nations began
inducting more men into Navy, Air Force and Army. In the East, Japan increased its military force. Finally,
the World War II had been declared when even England and France tried to equip themselves with war
weapons.

(4) Failure of the League of Nations : In order to establish peace after the First World War, the
League of Nations was formed. But neither could it become a supreme organisation having sovereignty over
other nations of the world, nor did it have its own army to make the nations follow its principles. Member
nations were not obliged to take their problems to the League of Nations or to accept the judgement passed

ocial Science, Std. 9


--- PAGE 15 ---
by it. Many nations had moved out of the League of Nations. Initially, Russia and Germany snapped their
ties with the League of Nations. Later, Italy and Japan moved out because Italy had captured Abyssinia,
Japan had attacked Manchuria, Germany had snatched away some provinces of Czechoslovakia. Still, the
League of Nations could do nothing. The greed for power amongst several nations became stronger in the

League of Nations. It could not stop groupism. This was the biggest failure of the League of Nations.

(5) Treaty of Versailles : The Treaty of Versailles got its form in the Paris Peace Process at the
end of the First World War. Since Germany was found responsible for the war, it had to pay 6.5 billion pound
as war fine. Its Ruhr province was taken away. Rhine river had to be opened for international sea route.
Thus, such an unfair and humiliating treaty was forcibly imposed on Germany. The German dictator Adolf

Hitler called the Treaty of Versailles as ‘a piece of paper’ and announced to reject it
(6) Imperialistic Ambition of Adolf Hitler : Hitler laid the foundation of the Second World

War. He had a fierce nationalist and militarist nature. That’s why, he wished the unity, stability and prosperity of
Germany at any cost. The first victim of his imperialism was Austria. Along with German army, he entered
Austria on 12" March, 1938.

On the very next day of the Munich Convention, Germany had captured Czechoslovakia (1* October,
1938). After that, it had captured the Mamal Port of Lithuania in March, 1939. Thus, a grand German nation

was created by Hitler. His imperialist policy was the main cause of the Second World War.

(7) German attack on Poland - an immediate cause : The above mentioned causes had made
the whole world to sit on a heap of ammunitions. A small spark could blow up the whole world. And this
spark was German attack on the peaceful Poland (September 1, 1939; early morning). Thus, World War
II had begun. Britain and France warned Germany to stop the war immediately but Germany ignored the

warning. Hence, Britain and France plunged into this war. Consequently, the war spread in the entire world.

World War II — An Outline

With the commencement of the World War II, the world
was again divided into two groups. On one side was the
group of Allied Nations lead by England and France. On the
other side was the group of Axis Nations comprising of Ger-
many, Italy and Japan. Besides these, some other factors
with war-driven mentality had entered into this. Japan at-
tacked the American Navy at Pearl Harbour. As a result,
America gave up on its neutral stand and retaliated. It joined
the Allied Nations, thus making it stronger. When the war
was going on in full swing, America dropped Atom bombs on
the two Japanese cities, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, in order to

stop Japan from moving any further. One lakh twenty four

thousand Japanese citizens lost their lives and there was

absolute destruction. Japan surrendered (11" August, 1945)

3.1 Hiroshima

and World War II came to an end.

Effects of World War II — Immediate Effects
(1) Economic Effects : This war had caused horrendous destruction in the world. All the

involved nations had incurred huge expenses. America had spent 350 billion dollars and other nations had spent
more than one thousand billion dollar. Property worth the same had been destroyed too. England lost its property
worth two thousand crore and about Germany, one can’t imagine! The nations of the world gave more impor-
tance to the production of arms and ammunition. So there was a scarcity of things for basic needs. Production
reduced, inflation increased, people were struggling for livelihood. There was scarcity of necessary goods in the
market. The economic life of people was shattered. As a result, the nations of the world were pushed into an

economic depression. There were major changes in the world politics and economy.

(2) Communism in China : Many nations of the world were impressed by the way Russia had made
a fast progress with its communist measures, with the Bolshevik Revolution (1917). China, too, was impressed.
Japan had become weak after the Second World War. Under these circumstances, its control over China
had receded. Taking advantage of this, Mao-Tse- Tung established communist rule in 1949, at the end of
a revolution in China.

(3) The Beginning of Cold War — long term effects : After the World War II, the world was divided
into two superpowers i.e. America and Russia. During the war, both the nations were friends. But after
the war, the differences of opinion between them went on increasing. Thus, the democratic America and
the communist Russia became mutually opposite groups. Other small nations of the world joined these two
groups according to their convenience. The war of words and the war of ideologies that both super powers
initiated in order to support or oppose each other’s opinion, created the atmosphere of Cold War. Many a
times, the situation for the Third World War seemed to be created.

War IT, on 24" October, 1945, the United Nations was established with the purpose of peace, security and co-
existence in the world. Its headquarters was to be in New York.

America’s efforts to establish United Nations had already begun from the time it joined the Second World
War. The American President Roosevelt made four important announcements regarding freedom while giving
his message to the American Congress, with the intention of human freedom, peace and security.

(1) Freedom of speech and thought (2) Freedom
of religion (3) Economic freedom (4) Right to freedom

from fear

Later, President Roosevelt and the British Prime
Minister Churchill prepared an eight-point agreement
while they were on a ship in the Atlantic Ocean, which

later came to be known as the Atlantic Agreement. The

agreement included matters like maintaining freedom and
sovereignty of every nation, peace, security, social and
economic welfare and disarmament. Then, the foreign ministers of Britain, America, Russia and China met in
Moscow, for world peace, which came to be known as Moscow Declaration. In November, 1943, three super-
powers held a conference in Tehran. The representatives of 50 nations prepared the agreement for the United
Nations at Washington (September, 1944), On October 24, 1945, the 51 member nations declared the establish-

ment of United Nations. India is also a part of it. Since then, 24th October is celebrated as United Nations Day
all over the world. Presently, 193 Nations are members of the United Nations.

4 | National Movements in India

Introduction

During their stay in India, Britishers became familiar with the political condition of India. The British
East India Company took advantage of the political disputes or internal weaknesses of India and from 1757
A.D., after creeping in to Bengal, to the revolt of 1875 A.D., it established its supremery over India in its
100 years of rule. In order to maintain this supremacy, the English, gradually, developed a strong administrative
structure in the country. Through this administrative structure, common laws, common administration and
a legal system according to the British system, came into existence. Yet, the English residing in India
established such laws and administration that England would get more benefits. At the cost of India, they
made England prosperous and exploited India the most.

The Great National Uprising of 1857

Some of the factors that caused the uprising of 1857 were political dissatisfaction, economic exploitation,
social and religious factors, military factor and immediate reasons like induction of the enfield Rifle in the
army. Mangal Pandey was the first martyr of the uprising. Several revolutionaries like Nanasaheb, Tatya,
Tope, Raja Kuwarsinh, Rani Laxmibai, Bahadurshah Zafar etc. took part in it. The uprising of 1857 produced
many effects among which are the end of the Company Rule in India and the rule of the British Crown
(ruled by Queen Victoria), change in administrative, military, social, religious policies. The reasons responsible
for the failure of the 1857 uprising are the beginning of the uprising before the planned time, lack of central
leadership, insufficient & unsophisticated weapons, importance of self-centered interests than nationalism
amongst revolutionaries, lack of suitable and organised leadership etc. You've already studied these in detail
in the previous class.

Boycott and Indigenous Movements

Boycott and indigenous movement along with Bangbhang Movement (1905) was one of the important
events of the Indian national movements. Because of the ‘divide and rule’ policy as a result of the Britishers'
Machiavellian Policies, boycott and indigenous movement get an impetus.

Bengal was a big province at the time of British rule, Which included the present day Bengal, Bihar
and Odisha. Compared to other states, Bengal was the central point of national awakening. The impetus
and thought for the national movement came from Bengal. In the 1857 revolt, Hindus and Muslims had
collectively fought the English. That's why, through the English strategy of ‘divide and rule’, they encouraged
communalism & caused division among people.

Viceroy Curzon (1899-1905) divided the vast Bengal Province into East Bengal and West Bengal, in
the name of bringing about administrative efficiency.

There was a strong opposition to the division of Bengal. When Bengal was divided on 16" October,
1905, the whole Bengal observed the day as ‘National Mourning Day'. The same day, an announcement,
about boycotting all foreign goods and encourgement to use indigenous goods, was made. Not merely bengalis,
but the other Indians also began to believe that this division had been done to curtail the vociferous feeling
of nationalism that was catching up in India. That day, Hindus and Muslims tied rakhis to each other in the
entire Bengal to express their unity. This movement had three major characteristics (1) adopt indigenous

products (Swadeshi) (2) boycott foreign goods (3) adopt national education.

India benefitted a lot due to this Swadeshi Movement, while the English industry was badly affected
due to the boycott of foreign goods. The cloth coming from Manchester, stopped. Sugar, shoes, cigarettes,
tobacco etc imported from England also reduced and the sale of cloth made in India, increased. Factories
for making indigenous goods were started. The effect of the Movement was felt in other provinces of India
like Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Mumbai, Madras etc. besides Bengal. The echo of the

ational Movements in India


--- PAGE 22 ---
Swadeshi Movement was felt in Gujarat too. The echo of the movement was also felt strongly in the British
Parliament and just within six years (1911), the division of Bengal was scrapped after a rethinking by the
Parliament. This was a memorable victory by the Indians, a victory of the relentless united efforts. This
was a noteworthy victory of the new awakening against the English rule.

Muslim League (1906)

By adopting the ‘divide and rule’ policy, the English wanted to create a conflict between Hindus and
Muslims. The then viceroy Lord Minto and the Indian Vizier (Diwan/Vazir) Morley together planned to crush
the Indian nationalism. When the national fight became stronger, the English began to favour the upper class
Muslims. The English became successful in convincing a group of Muslims that they must from a Muslim
organization to demand for separate voting rights and separate voting centres. As a result, Muslim League
was formed (1906). Religious head of the Muslims Agakhan, Nawab of Dhaka Salimullakhan, Viceroy Minto
and his personal minister Dunlop Smith had played an important role in the establishment of this organisation.
In order to stop the Muslims from attending the annual conference of the Congress, the annual conference
of the Muslim League was arranged on the same day as that of the Congress. Thus, the demand for separate
representation is not the brain child of the Muslims but that of the English policy. Minto started the policy
of taking Muslims as associates.That's why, many writers consider Minto as the father of Muslim
communalism. A historian also goes to the extent of saying that, 'the real creator of Pakistan was not
Mohmadali Jinnah or Rahitmatulla, butLord Minto’. Since then only, the conflict between Hindus and Muslims

increased and resulted in the division of India !

Birth And Development of Extreme Revolotionary Movement
The Revolutionary activity in India was started by Vasudev Balvant
Phadke. Revolutionaries like Damodar Chaphekar, and Balkrishna
Chaphekar brothers, Vir Savarkar, Baarindranath Ghosh, Khudiram Bose,
Praful Chaki, Ramprasad 'Bismil’, Ashfaqullakhan, Chandrashekhar ‘Azad’
Bhagatsingh, Shivram Rajguru, Sukhdev, Batukeshwar Dutt, Roshansingh etc
carried on the torch of nationalism. Youth trained in making and using

weapons were a constant threat for the English government.

Fierce revolutionary movements began in India and spread in the other
countries as well. The circumstances in its background were the cancellation Vasudey Balvant Phadke
of the partition of Bengal, the partition of two groups ie. "Jahal" (radicals)
and 'Maval' (moderates) at the Congress Conference in Surat (1907), and the terrific opposition to practice
of Congress of making only resolutions and requests. Lal-Bal-Pal trio adopted the radical attitude which
brought new life in the young Indian activists. The lethargic policies of the Indian National Congress got

a solid new turn.

Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak declared in firmly, ‘Freedom’ is my
birthright and I will achieve it anyhow’. This became the maxim for the
revolutionary freedom fighters.

At that time, a group of Indian youth undertook activities to seek
freedom from foreign rule. These extreme revolutionaries were more than

happy to sacrifice their lives for the motherland. They could give up their

lives or take lives in order to attain freedom.
Revolutionary activities spread in Maharashtra, Bengal, Punjab,

Bal dhar Tilak
Bihar, Orissa, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madras province, Uttarpradesh and aeangacyar ala

central India. Among these activities were some like ‘Mitramela Society’, ‘Abhinav Bharat Samaj’, ‘Anushilan
Samiti’, ‘Anjuman-e-Muhillane Vatan’, Indian Patriots Association (later ‘Bharatmata’) etc. and thus gave
impetus to revolutionary activities.

In the first stage, newspapers and magazines like ‘Yugantar’, ‘Navshakti’ and ‘Vandematram’, ‘Kesari’
‘Maratha’ gave constant strength to the activities. About 34 revolutionaries were prosecuted in the Alipur
massacre. Several revolutionaries were arrested in ‘Howrah massacre’ and 'Dhaka massacre’. Attempt to
kill Lord Hardinge by throwing a bomb; dropping bomb on Viceroy Minto on November 13, 1909 outside
Raipur darwaja in Ahmedabad can all be given as example of these.

In the second stage (1920-42), events like ‘Kakori Loot Case’, ‘Lahore massacre’ and dropping of
bomb on Central Parliament (Delhi) took place. You have already studied about the other revolutionaries
engaged in all these activities
Fierce Revolutionary Movement in Gujarat

Sri Aurobindo Ghosh was the pioneer of armed revolution in Gujarat. But he remained behind the curtain.
His brother Baarindrakumar Ghosh always remained in the forefront (1902). He arrived in Gujarat and moved
towards the southern part. Here, he met Shri Chotubhai and Shri Ambubhai Purani — very able companions.
Sakaria Swami met him on the banks of Narmada. This Swami was associated with Queen of Jhansi at
the time of the revolt of 1857. Baarindrakumar involved some of the middle class youth from Vadodara,
Charotar region (Kheda) Ahmedabad, Mehsana in the revolution. In this relation, the buggy of Viceroy Minto
was bombed outside at Raipur Darwaja in Ahmedabad.

Shri Aurobindo Ghosh described the scheme for revolution in his book named ‘Bhavani Mandir’. It was
also translated into Gujarati and published in the journal ‘Dakshina’ Besides this, booklets with titles like 'Deshi
Vanaspati Davao', 'Nahavana Sabu Banavvani Reet’, 'Kasrat', 'Gulab no Kisso', 'Kayada no Sangrah' etc

were published in order to spread the thoughts of revolution, so that Britishers won't understand ! These

National Movements in India


--- PAGE 24 ---
booklets contained methods of preparing bombs. 'Gangnath Vidyalay' was established near Chandod — Karnali,
where secret revolutionary activities were carried out. Many Gujarati youth joined these revolutionary
activities against whom Stern action was taken by the government. But the fight did not stop and finally

government realised that suppression would not help to rule over India.

Revolutionary Movement in Foreign Countries

The revolutionary movement began in foreign countries also for giving freedom to India from theBritish
The revolutionary activities that began in India spread to different aT
countries like England, Canada, America, Germany, France, Myanmar
(Burma), Malaya, Singapore, Afghanistan, Russia.
The active revolutionary who took part in revolutionary activities

in foreign countries are :

Shyamji Krishna Verma, Madanlal Dhingra, Vir Savarkar, Lala
Hardayal, Udhamsingh, Raja MahendraPratap, Medam Bhikhaji Cama,
Sardarsingh Rana, Maulana Abdulla, Maulana Basir, Champak Raman

Pillai, Dr. Mathursinh "Khudabaksh” were associated with their activities.

The revolutionary activities in the foreign countries gave impetus
to the revolutionary activities in India. Pistols were being secretly sent
to India from England along with the beddings of cooks. Madanlal
Dhingra killed William Wylie who used to criticize the revolutionaries.
In 1907, the Indian Independence League’ was established in California,
America, which was later named as 'Gadar Party’ by Lala Hardayal.
A weekly named 'Gadar' was published in four languages. Taraknath Das

and Kartarsingh too joined this activity. Champak Raman Pillai formed ;
Madanlal Dhingra

the ‘Hind Rastriya Swaymsevak Dal’ in Germany Plan was made to ;
and Udhamsingh

attack India by making Iraq as the headquarter (1907) In the
International Socialist Conference’ held in Stuttgart, Germany, the
national flag prepared by Madam Cama was hoisted for the first time
Raja Mahendra Pratap formed the Provisional Independent Government
under ‘Rastra Pramukh’ in Afghanistan in which Barkatulla, Abidulla,
Maulana Bashir, Shamshersingh, Dr. Mathursingh etc. also joined. This
govt. made efforts to get help from Russia, Iran, Turkey etc. They also
met the Turkish chief Anwar Pasha and the Governor. The conspiracy

‘Galibnama' written on ‘reshmi rumal' (Silk handkerchief) asking all
Muslims to unite and fight against Christians, was exposed ! Raja Shyamji Krishna Verma
Mahendra Pratap sent a golden strip, with his signature to the Russian
Czar, in which he had requested the Czar to sever all ties with England.
Russian revolutionary Trotsky had pledged all his support to the Indian
revolutionaries. Sohanlal Pathak in Burma and Parmanand in Singapore
carried on revolutionary activities. In addition to this, the Kamagatamaru
and Toshamaru steamer events provided inspiration to the Indian
revolutionaries staying abroad to fight against the British.

The Indian youth, in the age group of 18 - 24 years were mainly ca . b

involved in the radical freedom movement. They used to carry out any Ma dam Cama

kind of thrilling acts as they did not fear death. When caught, they readily

ocial Science, Std. 9


--- PAGE 25 ---
embraced death shouting slogans like 'Inquilab Zindabad' and 'Vande Mataram’' for the purpose of freedom
of their motherland. Their sacrifices would provide inspiration to the young generation for ages.

Morley — Minto Reforms (1909)

The English adopted the policy of ‘Divide and Rule’ to create enmity between Hindus and Muslims
(1906). Under the leadership of Agakhan, Muslim delegation met Viceroy Minto. Morley was the Indian

Vizier at that time (1909). These reforms are known as Morley-Minto reforms.
Arrival of Gandhiji to India (1915)

Gandhiji returned to India (1915) after successfully fighting against racism in South Africa with
satyagrah. His political mentor (guru) was Gopalkrishna Gokhle and Spiritual mentor was Shrimad Rajchandra
from whom he got inspiration. Gandhiji travelled across India and observed the life of Indians. He considered

exploitation as the root of poverty in India and made plans to abolish British rule in India.
Rowlatt Act. (1919)

The British government formed the Rowlatt Act under the Chairmanship of Rowlatt, the Minister of
Law (1919).

This act was framed with the purpose of suppressing revolutionaries and nationalists. This Act came

to be known as ‘Black Act’ because it was meant to suppress individual freedom and freedom of speech.

According to this Act, any suspicious person could be arrested and jailed, without conducting any trial
against him. That's why Gandhiji called it ‘Black Act’ and Motilal Nehru considered it as 'snatching away,

of argument, appeal and advocacy’.

The British government gained immense power, under this Act, to suppress any kind of opposition. So
leaders and people at large, expressed their opposition. Meetings, rallies, shows and strikes were organised
against it. Gandhiji was arrested in Delhi. When Dr. Satyapal and Dr. Kitchlu were arrested in Punjab, the
agitation became severe. The government vehemently

tried to suppress all opposition.

Jallianwala Bagh Massacre (13 March 1919)

When popular leaders like Dr. Satyapal and Dr.
Kitchlu were arrested in Amritsar, Punjab, a public
gathering was organised in the Jallianwala Bagh in
Amritsar, on the day, of Baisakhi, to oppose the arrest.

General Odonil Dyer reached there with his troops
and without any warning, opened fire on innocent people

4.1 Jallianwala Bagh Massaere

from the machine gun. There were high walls on four
sides of the Bagh. In the middle, was an unused well
and the only way out being narrow, a number of people
lost their lives in the firing. According to the government

report, 379 people died and 1200 injured. As per the

‘ i committee appointed by the congress, 1000 people had

died in the firing. "Hunter Commission’, investigating the case on behalf of the British Government, defended
General Dyer. The commission forgave Dyer considering it as ‘an innocent mistake that happened

unknowingly’. On the other hand, when Dyer returned to England, he was honoured with a sword and 2000
pounds ! Indians got a terrible shock because of this. After this inhuman act, Gandhiji's faith towards the
British was completely lost. This event played an important role in uniting the whole nation. This tragedy
became the ground for the future Non Co-Operation movement.

Khilafat Movement

During the First World War, Turkey joined the German side. So when England won, the treaty that
was made, had many firm and unjust terms and conditions for the losing side. The sultan of Turkey, at that
time, was a Khalifa - Head of Muslims. The Movement in India, to oppose the strict terms imposed on Turkey
and the sultan, came to be known as Khilafat Movement. Ali brothers - Maulana Shaukatali and Maulana
Mohammad Ali - were the chief leaders of the Movement. Gandhiji requested the congress to support the

Movement, Keeping Hindu-Muslim unity in mind.
The Movement became severe with the Congress
support.

Non Co-operation Movement (1920-22)

The Nagpur Conference gave the approval to
Non-Co-operation Movement (December, 1920).
Now, the Congress made a strong demand for
independence of India (Swarajya) instead of self-
government (Swashasan) under the rule of the

British Empire.

Constructive Aspect

In the positive aspect of the movement was
Hindu-Muslim unity to be strengthened, insistence

(MO BAAN) Sar
4.3 Common people in Non-Co-operation Movenment
on using ‘Swadeshi' articles, revival of spinning wheels in every house, collection of one crore rupees for
"Tilak Swarajya Fund', abolition of untouchability, national education, prohibition etc.

Negative Aspect

The negative aspects consisted of giving up of government jobs, government school-colleges, boycott
legislatures, resign from government courts, local self-government, boycott foreign cloth and other articles,
government functions, titles etc.
Programmes for Non Co-operation Movement

In the beginning of the Movement, Mahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore surrendered their titles
‘Kaiser-e-hind’ and ‘Knighthood honour' respectively. Other leaders of the nation also gave up their titles
and positions. Students left English schools and colleges. At various places, foreign clothes were set on fire.
When Duke of Kainatt came to India, he was boycotted (1921, November). The ceremony of honouring
Prince of Wales was boycotted. Such incidents created considerable national excitement. On the other hand,
national schools and colleges were established, like Kashi, Bihar, Jamia-Milia, Gujarat etc Vidyapiths. Due
to the vigorous propaganda for Swadeshi goods, the import of cloth, footwear, luxurious items from England
reduced drastically. This reaction rattled the British Parliament. The government was shocked by this kind
of huge economic loss to England.

More than one crore rupees was collected in the Tilak Fund. On many occasions, the Hindu-Muslim
emerged predominantly. The 'Mopla Revolt’ (Malabar) between Hindu landlords and Muslim peasants
deserves criticism and it was suppressed by the British army.

ocial Science, Std. 9


--- PAGE 27 ---
The government adopted the policy of suppression. Uncontrolled lathicharge, firing, collective arrests
and inhuman torture was meted out. Unsuccessful attempts to break Hindu-Muslim unity were made.

The Chauri-Chaura Incident and Withdrawal of the Movement

People took out a rally in the Chauri-Chaura Village in Gorakhpur, Uttarpradesh. The police opened
fire on the people. But when they ran short of bullets, people attacked the police station and set on fire
in which 21 policemen died. On receiving this horrible news, Gandhiji said, 'I have committed a Himalayan
blunder by giving the tool of Satyagraha in the hands of people who do not understand the value of non-
violence’. He suspended the Movement immediately.

Importance of Non-Co-opertion and its effects

This Movement did not achieve its desired aims, but through its negative and constructive aspects,
managed to generate in people, awareness of their rights. A negative atmosphere, aginst the government,
was created. There was a strong feeling of opposition against injustice. There was a political awareness
among all the classes of India. The faith in independence became stronger. The fear of lathi, punishment
and imprisonment was removed. The youth and women too came forward to serve their nation and Congress
became an organisation of the people. schools giving national education began. Hindi started getting more
importance than English. The Movement that was limited to cities and towns and intellectuals, spread to
the people and villages.

Swarajya Party

With the purpose of retaining the national awareness among people, Chittaranjan Das Munshi and Motilal
Nehru formed the Swarajya Party after the withdrawal of the Non-Co-operation Movement. Their purpose
was to enter the legislative assemblies and oppose the unfair policies of the government. The leaders of
the Swarajya Party also adopted the constructive activities of Gandhiji like abolition of untouchability, Hindu-
Muslim unity, revival of spinning wheel, liquor prohibition etc.

Swarajya Party contested the election of the legislatures held in November, 1923 and the candidates
of the Swarajya Party were elected in the central legislature as well as the Provincial Legislature and got
clear majority. It did not get the majority in Bengal but emerged as a strong party. Motilal Nehre was elected
into the central Legislature as the party leader and Chittaranjan Das was elected in the Bengal Province.

Swarajya Party disapproved the government budgets and proposals and resented the unjust policies of
the government. It compelled the government to consider the problems of the people. Due to the working
of the Swarajya Party only, government had to appoint the Simon Commission two years earlier.

The Swarajya Party functioned in a disciplined manner and established high parliamentary practices.
It proved to the British government that Indians can rule constitutionally and democratically. The educated
class of India was thus attracted to the Swarajya Party. National awareness re-emerged in the people. The
party played a crucial role in bringing the achievement of independence very near. All this indicates the
importance of the Party.

With the death of Chittaranjan Das in June, 1925, the Swarajya Party became weak. Some members
began supporting the government while others established a new party named the National Party. Thus, the
prestige of the Swarajya Party, reduced. In the 1926 election, all its members lost terribly except in Madras

Province. Bipinchandra Pal and Surendranath Bannerji even criticized the Party strongly.

Movement Towards Independence

The period from 1920 to 1947 is considered as Gandhian age and the Gandhian movements of struggle for
Independence. This second stage of national movement of India is the struggle for having Constitutional rights,
moreover, it is the struggle for the freedom of India too. This struggle passed through a stream of events and
there was a uniform effect of it. So we shall observe the effects in this chapter.

Simon Commission (1942)

Montford(Montague Chelmsford1919) amendment declared that a commission should be sent to India
after ten years to examine the effects and operations of the constitutional reforms and to suggest more reforms
for India but two years later government appointed Simon commission. The commission consisted of Sir John
Simon and seven other members. All of them were members of the British Parliament. There was not a single
Indian as a member. Indians recommended inclusion of Indian members in the commission so as to understand
the problems and pains of Indian society but Britishers rejected this recommendation. So, the Indians decided to
oppose it. Simon Commission was greeted with strikes, assembly, processions, loud slogans of ‘Simon, Go Back’
and unfurling of black flags and apparel. The British government suppressed the movement mercilessly. The
Assistant Police Suprintendent ordered lathi charge on Lalaji's procession. Lala Lajpatrai was injured seriously
while taking the lead of the procession in Lahore. Few months later he passed away. The news of Lalaji's death
instigated Veer Bhagat Singh, Sukdev and Rajguru, therefore they killed Saunders.

Nehru Committee

With the opposition of Simon Commission, Hindi Vazeer
Burkenhead presented a draft of the Constitution as in Simon
Commission in which, it stated that the Indian leaders of all parties
formulate appropriate constitution which the British government will
further think upon.By understanding the challenges of this report,
National General Assembly President drafted Nehru committee
report. This report which was given is known as Nehru Report which
states the Dominion Status, Independent Judiciary, Fundamental Rights,

and Adult Suffrage. Eventually the British government rejected the
recommendations made in this report. Motilal Nehru

Demand for Complete Independence, 1929

During this time National Assembly members Jawaharlal Nehru,
Subhash Chandra Bose were active national leaders. They were the
propagators of Complete Independence. Youth of India were not happy
with the Dominion Status. On the banks of the river Raavi in Lahore,
under the leadership of Jawaharlal Nehru, National General Assembly
passed a resolution of Complete Independence .After that, on 26"
January, 1930, the members took the Oath of Complete Independence.
Since then, January 26"has become memorable for all of us. Indepen-

dent India has made the Republic Day memorable by implementing the

Constitution of India on this day.

Dandi Yatra

Dandi Yatra : (From March 12 to April 6, 1930)

As a part of Civil Disobedience
Movement, Gandhiji decided to go to Dandi
village by its sea-coast to break the Salt Law.
On the of 11 March evening, in the assembly
of thousands of people, the message of
Satyagrah was sent. Even if people got
arrested, with firm determination of non-vio-
lence, struggle against government continued.
On 12" March, 1930, under his leadership,
Gandhiji commenced 'Dandi Yatra’ with his
supporters from Harijan Ashram (Now Gandhi
Ashram) singing the hymn "Vaishnav jan to tene
re kahiye je, peed parayi jaane re’. Gandhiji
said, In Dandi yatra (29th March, 1930) “ I
shall die the death of crow and dog, but I
will not return to this Ashram without at-
taining Poorna Swaraj’. “Brave never run

away from struggle, the one who runs by seeing the struggle is not
brave.” Gandhiji, along with his supporters started the Dandi march.
This march was 370 kms which included Aslali, Bareja, Nadiad
, Anand, Boriavi, Ras, Jambusar, Bharuch, Surat, Navsari as well
as small and large regions. During Dandi March in these regions,
people were explained the reason for Civil Disobedience
Movement and breaking the Salt Law.As Dandi March passed
through these small and large towns, people used to clean the village
roads, decorate their houses with torans and showed conscience
for this satyagraha.Dandi Yatra had a wonderful effect in creating
astonishing faith, unity and consciousness among people. All of the
nation was having a wave of satyagrah. Gandhiji along with his
colleagues and supporters reached Dandi after 24 days of march

(5"April, 1930). On early morning of April 6", Gandhiji broke the Salt

the Salt Law

Route of Dandi March

Law by picking a handful of salt from the sea-coast. In a loud
voice Gandhiji stated , “ [have broken the Salt law” and while
addressing the people gathered there, he uttered , “I, by this
event, am applying salt to the foundation of building in the form
of British Empire.” Shri Mahadevbhai Desai has compared this
event as ‘Mahabhiniskraman’ — the great renunciation.
Journalists, Photographers, Writers, Historians of India and
across the world visited and published report about what they
witnessed, in their own newspapers and booklets. In this way,
the Dandi Yatra which started from Sabarmati Ashram on 12th
March, was nationaly acclaimed, achieved its physical
completion, but it started applying salt to the foundation of
building in the form of British Empire. Civil Disobedience
Movement generated new national consciousness among
people of India.The British Police beat them mercilessly.
Lathicharge, arrest, shooting and oppression on women and
children continued but agitation did not decrease.


--- PAGE 31 ---
During Dandi March, numerous constructive programmes like boycott of foreign clothes, prohibition of
liquor , removing untouchability, Hindu-Muslim unity and oath to do social services etc were held.

Dandi Yatra and Breaking of Salt Law brought not only nationwide consciousness but it brought fame in
aspects of non-violence struggle and movements worldwide.Processions, programmes and assemblies were
conducted for boycotting foreign goods, prohibition of foreign liquor and picketing on liquor making, not giving
revenue tax,satyagraph for removal of untouchability. To weaken these agitations and struggles, the government
started lathicharge, imprisonment and other atrocities. People reacted by destroying of railway-station, post-
office, police-station and other government buildings. Incidents like suppression of agitation under the leadership
of Abdul Gafar Khan 'Frontier Gandhi' at Vadala, Bombay, struggle against foreign liquor under the leadership of
Kasturba Gandhi in Bombay , Gharsana in Surat and in Viramgam during the Salt Law agitation, renunciation of
government services as well as removal of children from government schools were the major highlights of these
movements.

Gandhi-Irwin Pact, Round Table Conference and Moratorium of Satyagrah

Gandhiji was called upon by the Britishers for the Round Table Conference related to the Constitutional
structure and reforms. First Round Table Conference was held but with the absence of congress leaders it was
futile. To reconcile with congress, a pact between Gandhiji and Irwin was made which was known as Gandhi-
Irwin Pact (March 1931) in which permission of free collection or manufacture of salt by persons near the sea-
coast and permission of peaceful picketing were the main points. In the second Round Table Conference Gandhiji
was the only representative from congress and Britishers had discriminating points for various religious commit-
tees to which Gandhiji was deeply disappointed and therefore the Conference was dissolved.

Quit India Movement

Keeping in mind the World War situation ,the Congress Working Committee decided to end the Individual
Satyagrah.(January, 1942)

The British Government attempted to deceive people of India by Cripps Mission. So Indians were angry
and dejected. Therefore , people of India no longer had faith in the British rulers. They assumed that the British
do not wish to quit India. Gandhiji advised the people to come out of despair and be prepared to give a new and
last fight.

On August 9", 1942 resolution of ‘Quit India Movement’ was passed in the working committee of
Congress held at Mumbai.On the second day of the resolution, Gandhiji, Vallabbhai Patel, Jawarharlal Nehru,
Maulana Azad and other eminent congress leaders were arrested. Newspapers were banned. Regional and
district level congress leaders were arrested simultaneously. Arrest of Gandhiji and other leaders resulted in
nationwide strike and to this Gandhiji said “This is the last fight in my life and therefore people of India should
make all attempt to achieve independence.” He gave the slogan “Do or Die.”

Strikes during Quit India Movement

The rural and urban regions of the country including workers, farmers, youth, students, teachers, business-
men and women were in the forefront of this movement. Workers went on strike in factories. Iron factories in
Jamshedpur and Cotton mills at Madras too were on strike. | lakh mill workers of 75 cotton mill industries in
Ahmedabad went on peaceful strike for 105 days. Colleges and schools observed strike. For nearly 3 and half
months markets in Ahmedabad were closed.

Harmful activities during Quit India Movement

Anger against British Government was being expressed from every nook and corner of the country. Sup-
pression against peaceful people by the Britishers led to a violent situation as people not only ransacked the post
offices, telegram departments, police stations, railway stations, government buildings, school and college build-
ings, railway lanes, pools, bridges and roads but looted the assets and set on fire the government properties. In
this railway incurred the heaviest losses. In many of the areas people used bombs.

(33) Movement Towards Independence


--- PAGE 32 ---
Failure of the Government in crushing the struggle

The Government tried to suppress the movement with hard hand. The struggle started from a small end to
a large extent by ransacking government system. More than 70,000 people were imprisoned, 538 gunshots were
fired, 1028 people lost their lives, 3200 people were injured. Students were injured in gunshots especially in
Ahmedabad and Patna. A unique political consciousness was created among the people .This movement gave
clear warning to the British Government and a message to the world at large that India cannot be enslaved any
more. The struggle really signalled by the people of India, to Britishers, to Quit India. The people of India now
wanted full independence. The amendment for Dominion Status was almost invisible by this struggle. After a
struggle of 5 years India achieved independence.
Azad Hind Fauj and Subhash Chandra Bose

Subhash Chandra Bose was born in Cuttack in Orissa state (23 January, 1897).His father
RaiBhadurJanikinath Bose was a government lawyer in British juidiciary.His mother Parvatidevi was a philan-
thropist. Prediction was that, this Bengali lad will become sincere servant of Britishers. But he went on to
become a staunch freedom fighter against British Empire. After passing examination with good marks from
Calcutta’s Presidency College ,he went to England for further studies. He passed the very difficult ICS (Indian
Civil Service) examination at fourth number, and returned to Calcutta. Seeds of revolution were planted in his
mind due to the insulting attitude and pride of the British professors at the Presidency College towards the
Indians. He was very much interested in the Indian Independence struggle. He became an active member of
National Assembly. He joined the Swarajya Party in 1923.He soon became very popular leader among youths.
He was in the top in Civil Disobedience Movement and therefore jailed many times. At the young age of forty-
one he was elected as president of Congress convention at Haripura (Surat) and showcased his ability.
He left the Congress as differ-
ence of opinion with Gandhiji had
increased and he established a
party, the Forward Bloc. To
awaken plebiscite against
Britishers he travelled most of the
regions of India. He was
arrested under Indian Defence
Code and imprisoned. During im-
prisonment, he was ill-treated.
He was imprisoned at his place
of residence as his health was

deteriorating since he was

fasting ‘Unto the Death’. He Gandhiji & Subhash Chandra Bose
travelled in the disguise of Pathan from Calcutta via Peshawar, Kabul, Iran and Russia, later on he

reached Berlin, Germany (238° March, 1942).Indians living in Germany gave him warm welcome. He urged
the people of India through Berlin radio to fight against British Empire. He also met Hitler in Germany and
discussed in detail about the independence of India. He then went to Rome and Paris to establish military unit
for the Independence of India and recruited 3000 thousand Indians. Rasbihari Bose, a revolutionary living in
Japan, chained all the organization and established Indian Independence League. To make India free,
Azad Hind Fauj was set up. A presence of 100 Indian delegates from Malaya, Japan, Sumatra, Java, Hong
Kong, Borneo, Andaman, Burma, (Brahmdesh; now Myanmar) were in the organisation. And in that

ocial Science, Std. 9


--- PAGE 33 ---
Mohan Singh, a war prisoner arrested by Japan, was also present. Moreover RasBihari Bose voluntarily retired
as head of INA.

Azad Hind Fauj and Indian Independence League

After breaking the tight British security, Subhash Chandra Bose cleverly reached Japan from Berlin ina
submarine in 1943. Moreover Rasbihari Bose of Indian Independence League invited Subhash Chandra Bose to
be the head of this League. Japan would provide every kind of help for the Indian Freedom. It was promised that
as Japanese army advances towards India capturing Indian provinces, provisional governments would be formed

and Japan would give them recognition.

On July 2, 1943, Subhash Chandra Bose went to Singapore from Japan and there he was elected as the
President of Indian Independence League on July 4, 1943.Moreover RasBihari Bose voluntarily retired as head
of Indian National Army (Azad Hind Fauj) and appointed Subhash Chandra Bose as head of INA. Indians,
residing there , got a proper and able leader for freeing their motherland. Since then Subhash Chandra Bose was
called ‘ Netaji’ .In his speeches and on radio , he gave slogans : “Chalo Delhi’ (Let’s march to Delhi) and “Tum
Muje khoondo, Mein tumhe Azadi doonga’’(Give me blood, I will give you freedom). With his skillful guidance, he
formed the parallel government. He tried to convince and urged the Indians residing in south-east Asia to

sacrifice everything for the struggle of Independence of India.
Establishment of Provisional Government by Subhash Chandra Bose

Subhash Chandra Bose formed provisional Indian government and he became its Prime Minister.
He allotted other departments to his companions and formed a cabinet. This government was recognised by
Japan, Germany, Italy, nationalised China and Burma. This government recognized Hindi as a national Language
and tri-colour as national Flag. It was decided to have income by assisting Japan , independent role and by
property tax .Netaji visited Andaman and Nicobar islands and named it as ‘ Shaheed’ (Martyr) and

‘Swarjya’ (Independence)
Last step and Martyrdom of Subhasbabu

In May, 1944, under the leadership of Netaji, his military units captured Rangoon, Prom, Kohima
(presently the capital of Nagaland) .Then it marched towards Imphal (now capital of Manipur) .But after the
dropping of two atom bombs at Nagasaki and Hiroshima in Japan, the financial assistance to the provisional
government stopped. British aircrafts started warfare against Azad Hind Fauj and so the condition became
critical. On (August 18, 1945) he started from Taipei airport of Formosa for Tokyo (Japan).But his plane caught
fire and he got serious burns and while undergoing treatment, he died. The mystery of his death has remained
unsolved till date.

Achieving Independence and Partition of India

The commanders of Indian national Army were arrested as prisoners of war and were accused of treason
and put on trial. Bulabhai Desai and Jawarharlal Nehru pleaded their case. The whole country took keen interest
in this case. When the British Government inflicted them with punishment, there were protests against them in
the entire country. So bowing to populist opinion, the government had to withdraw the punishment. These events
and with the naval mutiny of Bombay (1946), the British realised their rule in India will no longer be tenable.
On February 20, 1947 Attlee, the Prime Minister of Britain announced that the British Government shall give all

the powers to the Government of India as per the Cabinet Mission formula and shall quit India by June 1948.

(35) Movement Towards Independence


--- PAGE 34 ---
Thus, in a changed situation, Mountbatten was appointed as Viceroy in place of Lord Wavell. When he took
charge of his post, communal riots had started in India, the condition of India had become pathetic. In July 1946,
the Congress secured 201 seats out of 210 and Muslim League 73 seats out of 78 from provinces of India for the
prior formation of the Constituent Assembly. The League pressurised the government for Pakistan, on 16"
August, 1946. So terrible communal riots and tumult spread all over India. Looking at the situation in India
,»sardar Patel, Jawarharlal Nehru and other congress leaders felt there was no other alternative except accept-
ing the demand of Muslim League for Pakistan, because Muslim League and Jinnah insisted for separate
Pakistan. The Muslim League boycotted the first Cabinet meeting on December 9, 1946. The Muslim League
executive held on January 31, 1947, decided to boycott the cabinet meeting and gave a rapid and extensive
programme for the demand of Pakistan. Mountbatten convinced Nehru and Sardar Patel who understood the
matter that “having a well-organised Central Government having administrative units under the centre, shall be
more peaceful and progressive instead of weak Central Government consisting of many autonomous and oppo-
site constituents.” National leaders found this argument acceptable. Sardar Patel and Nehru discussed this
matter with Gandhiji , who also helplessly accepted arrangement of partition of India with heavy hearts.

Mountbatten Plan (1947) and Partition of India

On March 24,
Viceroy Mountbatten
presented his scheme.
According to him,
there was no alterna-
tive other than the Par-
tition of India. National
and prolific leaders like
Sardar Patel under-
stood the matter.
After many discus-
sions and pondering,
finally on June 3, 1947

Viceroy Mountbatten
decided to plan the Freedom and Acceptamce of Partiton in Meeting
partition of India. This (Photo related to Mount batten plan & Partition Of India)

plan is known as Mountbatten Plan. The Congress Leaders and Muslim League accepted this plan. When
Mountbatten Plan started getting implemented, the people of East Bengal and Sylhet province of Assam decided
to join East Pakistan, West Bengal and East Bengal were affiliated with India as per decision of their assembly,

West Punjab joined with Pakistan. It was decided to affiliate Northwest Province, Sindh and Baluchistan with
Pakistan.

Indian Independence Act (July 1947)

The British Parliament passed the Indian Independence Act according to Mountbatten Plan. According to
this, India’s first Governor General was Mountbatten and Janab Jinnah was the Governor General of Pakistan.
By this Act, India’s dependence on British rule came to an end. Therefore Gandhiji considers this Act as “The
one and only, best and beneficial Act given by the Bristishers to India”

ocial Science, Std. 9


--- PAGE 35 ---
The last viceroy of the British Governement, organised a function in New Delhi at the midnight of August
14" The Union Jack of England was brought down from the pole and the Indian National Flag, tricolour was
hoisted. The documents attributing independence to India were handed over by Mountbatten to C.Rajgopalachari,
the first Governor General of Independent India. Entire atmosphere was full of excitement. Entire process of
transfer of power was completed. August 15, 1947 was an excellent dawn for India. All celebrated the first
independence festival very pleasantly and cheerfully in the entire country. Everywhere people hung ““Torans”, a
good omen, on doors, sweets were distributed in schools, many people who had taken vow felt relieved on its
fulfilment but Gandhiji was shocked due to the partition of India and therefore he was deeply plunged into grief
and drifted into meditation.

India becoming Independent and the immediate problems of it

India and Pakistan, two separate, Independent nations, came into existence as a result of Mountbatten Plan
and Indian Independence Act, 1947. The resolution to the following problems had to be found out :
(1) Reorganisation of military forces (2) Disputes over assets and properties (3) Debts and Credits (4) Problem
and settlement of refugees (5) Public services and the arrangement of civil servants and administrative staff
(6) Demarcation of International boundries on eastern and western side of India to be fixed etc.

A five member committee, consisting of two representatives each from India and Pakistan was formed
under the chairmanship of Lord Mountbatten. The Committee appointed different commissions consisting of
experts of relevant subjects to solve all the problems. In case of any differences of opinion, both the nations
admitted to accept the final decision given by an arbitrator, consisting of one representative of India and one of
Pakistan, under the Chairmanship of the former Chief Justice of India. MilitaryCommandant General of India
complied the partition of army military weapons, etc., .The British army left India by February 28, 1948. All
officers and employees of administration, military, judiciary were given opportunity to choose whether they
would serve India or Pakistan. They were given assurance about their pay, allowance, security of service,
pension etc. A large number of refugees from both countries migrated, leaving their houses and properties. India
solved the tremendous problem of their rehabilitation and restoration very skilfully and patiently. The then Deputy
Prime Minister and Home Minister Sardar VallabhbhaiPatel merged about 562 small and big Princely States of
India into ‘Indian Union’. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's strong determination, iron will and diplomatic negotiations
solved the problems.

Yet, long-term planning, to find a solution to problems like effects of communal riots due to partition, the
shock of Mahatma Gandhi's death, to make Independent India, self-reliant with the help of good Govermance,
the weak condition of Indian agriculture, to create an atmosphere of peace and tranquility in the country, the
internal-external security of the country etc. became necessary.

6 | World After 1945

The pages of history are full of innumerable wars fought in ancient India and the world. Yet the most
destructive war which will always be remembered in the modern world is the FIRST AND the SECOND
WORLD WAR. The league of Nations was formed with the purpose of establishing permanent peace in the
world. But, due to certain limitations it failed and in 1939 World War-II broke out. The disturbed state of mind
and the horrors of World War II persuaded human beings to, once again, make efforts for peace and protection
of Independence. This resulted in the establishment of the United Nations (24 October, 1945).

The United Nations’ Charter

The United Nations’ Charter starts with the Preamble and it explains the goals of UNITED NATIONS.

Below given are the goals :

(1) There is a determination to save the future generation from the pangs of all destructive war. Here,

emphasis has been laid on responsibilities born out of international laws and mutual understanding.
(2) Emphasis has been laid on developing tolerance mutually so that the whole world develops socially.

(3) Economic, Social and Cultural problems should be solved with the intervention of United Nations and
human rights as well as basic freedom should be disseminated irrespective of caste, language, gender

or religion.
(4) Lastly, appeal to all the nations for co-operation to achieve these objectives.

Thus, United Nations’ Charter concludes that dismissal of war and constant urge for peace is the main

objective of United Nations.
Cold War (1945-1962) —Reasons and Consequences

Though the World War II got over, it resulted into creation of America and Russia as superpowers while
taking the place of England and France. In war, England, France, Russia and America were together but Rus-
sian administration policies created differences and thus America and England separated. A strong competition
between the two super powers, i-e., America and Russia, to establish supremacy over the world emerged after
Second World War. The power was centralised between two poles i.e., America and Russia. Therefore, this
time period is considered as bi-polar world order. Owing to extremely tense relations between two power blocs
this phase is known as the ‘Cold War Phase’. At various incidents both the superpowers almost came into

conflict with one another.

There was a basic change in relations among powerful nations of the world after the World War. America
and the Soviet Union, who had once allied and fought against the Nazi Germany and the Fascist Italy, emerged
as leaders of two rival power blocs and military powers. Thus the Cold War started between them. Though
Britain and France also had emerged victorious, yet they lost the status of great powers due to terrible ruination
caused by the ravages of war and ending of imperialism. Germany, Italy and Japan not only lost the War, but also
were ruined economically, politically and militarily. After the War, the Soviet Union (Russia) captured the eastern
areas of Germany and other eastern countries like Austria, Albania, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia,
Poland, Romania Bulgaria and the Baltic states. Later on, they gave away reins of power to respective

communist parties of those countries. They did this to continue their superiority on these countries. During 1949,

by conducting a nuclear test, the Soviet Union directly challenged the monopolistic nuclear powers of America.
Meanwhile, democratic system was gradually established in the western European countries that were liberated

by British and American forces.
The world destributed among Army group

One of the most important aspects of the conflict of ideology was mutual distrust and sense of doubt on the
intention of the rival group. Owing to fear born out of mutual distrust and doubts, both the power established their
own military bases. Led and inspired by America, western democratic countries on the North Atlantic Ocean
established a military organisation, NATO (North Atlantic Treaty organisation) in April 1949. Thereafter to
protect south eastern countries from the onslaught on the Soviet Union communism, America and England

established one more military organisation in 1945, SEATO ( South Eastern Asiatic Treaty organisation).

One more military organisation CENTO (Central Asia Treaty Organisation) was established in Middle
Eastern countries under the leadership and inspiration of England. Here, various Arab countries joined

CENTO. Later on, America took over its leadership.
Armament,Disarmament, Nuclear weapon creation and its application

The Cold War, which was meant for dominance over the world, gave rise to fierce competition among
superpowers. And for the sake of dominance, armament race was given high priority. America had used atom

bomb for the first time on two cities of Japan, namely Hiroshima and Nagasaki (1945),

This way America proved its supremacy. Within next four years, the Soviet Union too proved its capacity

of making atom bomb by conducting a nuclear test. This created a Power Balance between the superpowers.

America declared blockade of the communist Cuba, which was on southeast. To defend Cuba against
possible attacks of America, the Soviet Union sent ships loaded with nuclear missiles in the Caribbean Sea. Both
the superpowers threatened each other to use nuclear weapons. The world was almost on the verge of nuclear
war. Finally, leaders of America and the Soviet Union had a talk on the ‘Hotline’ for the first time. The Soviet
Union decided to withdraw its ships and America decided to curb nuclear missiles aimed towards Cuba. The
whole episode is known as ‘Cuban Crisis’. This episode is very important episode in world politics. It begins
communication between two superpowers. This incident is important towards the process of disarmament of

nuclear weapons. The entire ‘Cuban Crisis' is considered as the beginning of the end of the coldwar.

America, the Soviet Union, and the Britian agreed on maintaining control over nuclear production, experi-
ment and proliferation. This agreement is known as Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. France, of course, refused
to sign this treaty. China also conducted a nuclear test in 1964 and refused to sign the Treaty. This Treaty
imposed ban on conducting a nuclear test in open atmosphere. And of course, except communist China, the

other four were already permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. (possessing veto power.)

Apart from nuclear weapons and missiles, the superpowers have also developed chemical and biological
weapons. These weapons of mass destruction can kill millions of people without damaging any materialistic

wealth. People would die miserably while suffering from various diseases because of these lethal weapons.

During these decades, many important and far-fetching changes took place in international politics. Owing
to many reasons, the Cold War among super powers also ended and so the Nuclear Ban Treaty helped in this
concern. India has always welcomed this treaty but it is always a supporter of disarmament. The world will be
always in danger until the disarmament of lethal weapons is not done.

Rise of Independent Nations in Asia

India achieved independence in 1947 after long freedom struggle. Owing to Britain’s Policy of divide and
rule and certain other reasons, the country was divided into two nations, namely India and Pakistan. In the same
way, with continuous struggle against Britishers, countries like Srilanka and Myanmar got independence in
(1948) .In the case of Indonesia, the United Nations played an important role (1949). Asian countries like Laos,

Cambodia and Vietnam too got independence.
Rise of Independent Nations in Africa

The second World War proved to be a good omen for the enslaved Nations of Africa. After the Second
World War, countries like Abyssinia (Ethiopia), South Africa and Egypt were independent. The Second World
War and the freedom struggle in Asian countries inspired the other African countries too. It resulted in that
during the tenure of 16 years from 1951 to 1966, 40 small and large countries became free. Imperialist countries
tried to have supremacy over these countries but these countries either joined the superpowers or the military

resources and got their freedom.
Non-Aligned Movement

Some new nations adopted the policy of not to align with any of the two power blocs and military blocs.
They decided that they would maintain equal distance with both blocs. These nations were identified as ‘Non-

Aligned Nations’ and their foreign policy was called ‘Non-Aligned Policy’.

Those neutral nations, that did not want to adopt the ideologies of either of the two Superpowers of the
World, wished to have an all-round devlopment, maintaining its unique existence. Under the leadership of India’s
first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru; Indonesia’s first President, Sukarno; Egypt’s second President, Gamal
Abdel Nasser; Ghana’s first President Kwame Nkrumah; and Yugoslavia’s President, Josip Broz Tito got a thumb-
ing support for the movement. In this Non-Alignment Council 23 countries of Asia and 6 countries of Africa
were present.The organization was founded in Belgrade in 1961 known as NAM (Non-Aligned Movement).
Under the leadership of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru the policies of Non-Alignment were framed. NAM
completed valuable leadership. Nehru believed that movement continues to see a role for itself, as in its view,
the world’s poorest nations remain exploited and marginalised, no longer by opposing superpowers, but rather in
auni-polar world, and it is Western hegemony and neo-colonialism that the movement has really re-aligned itself
again. It opposes foreign occupation, interference in internal affairs and aggressive unilateral measures, but it
has also shifted to focus on the socio-economic challenges facing member states, especially the inequalities
manifested by globalization and the implications of neo-liberal policies. The Non-Aligned Movement has identi-

fied economic underdevelopment, poverty, and social injustices as growing threats to peace and security.

Today more and more countries have joined the Non-Aligned Movement. Union summit was held at Kuala
Lumpur on 13 May, 2003. For the last four decades many incidents have happened. With the disintegration of
Soviet Union and Russia’s power decreased. America emerged as a superpower .Imperial policy decreased to

minimum in other countries. In these situations, Non-Aligned Movement played a dominant role.

The Non-Aligned Nations, with their Non-Aligned policy, were successful in contributing towards World
Politics. The Non-Aligned movement was successful in showing off its moral impact for maintaining world
peace, stopping wars, maintaning human society and nationalism as well as the Superpowers adopting an atti-
tude of disarmament.

Partition and Unification of Germany
Germany was the main cause behind both the World Wars. It faced a humiliating defeat in World War II.

GH) World After 1945

All its state administration and economy collapsed completely. There was not a single large party left in the
whole of Germany that could rule the nation. In addition to that there was fear that Germany would pose threat
to the world once again, if it emerges as a military power once again. Therefore, the defeated Germany was
divided into four administrative segments. The ‘Soviet Red Army’, in the later phase of the war, had captured the
eastern part of Germany. Therefore, it was accepted that eastern Germany would remain in their control .Where
as it was decided that America would control south-western side of Germany. France would control its area
near France, while Britain would control areas of Germany bordering Belgium and Holland.

America, France and Britain started thinking about certain alternative arrangement. Meanwhile an atmo-
sphere of distrust and doubt had already started between two power blocs. America and other western Euro-
pean countries established “Federal Republic of Germany’ .This was administered jointly by America, Britain
and France. On the other side , the Soviet Union also declared ‘East Germany’ as ‘ Democratic Republic of East
Germany.’ Thus, after the War, two independent German states came into existence, namely West Germany
(democratic) and East Germany (communist). As Germany’s three western segments were united, three admin-
istrative segments of Berlin also united. In a reaction to this, Soviet Union, in April 1948, declared ‘Berlin
Blockade’ .This resulted into tremendous tension between the Soviet Union and the western countries. Later on,
a high and 42 km long wall separating western and eastern Berlin was constructed. The communist government
tried to prevent thousands of East German citizens from jumping and entering into the free atmosphere of
Western Germany. Many people lost their lives in doing so. After about four to four and half decades, Western
Germany made an astonishing development. Experts consider this as ‘German Miracle.’ There was no remark-
able change in the economic condition of East Germany .The East German communist government crushed all
hopes of its people for political freedom and rapid economic development.

Till 1990 many important and far-fetching changes took place in international politics. Owing to many
reasons, the Cold war among super powers also ended. These years witnessed cracks in other wise impreg-
nable Soviet Union. Ultimately Soviet Union was disintegrated. As a consequence of it, on October 3", 1990
both the Germany united. People broke down the German wall, which was a symbol of German division. People
considered demolition of the Berlin Wall as the end of the Cold War era and celebrated the occasion whole-
heartedly. Today unified Germany has turned out to be the strongest economic power in Europe. After 1990,
they have made a tremendous effort to be the strongest economic nation in the last decade. Today it has become
one of the most important and leading nations in the European Union.

Disintegration of Soviet Union

During the last decade of the twentieth century, Soviet Union's Prime Minister Mikhail Gorbachev's liberal
policy led to the disintegration of Soviet Union (Russia). Peaceful disintegration of Soviet Union is considered as
epoch-making in the international politics. Mikhail Gorbachev became the Prime Minister from a socialistic side
on 11" March, 1989. He had a liberal attitude. Russia had progressed tremendously in the field of science and
technology. They also had acquired capability to compete with superpowers like America.

Gorbachev adopted two policies ‘Glasnost and ‘Perestroika’. In this way Gorbachev introduced economic
and political reforms in the place of single-handed communist rule. The Stronghold of communist party, the
Soviet bureaucracy and the Red Army started weakening.

In 1990, process of the disintegration of the Soviet Union began. Towards the end, out of 15 states, 14
states became independent and disintegration of Soviet Union came to an end (December, 1991).

India’s Contribution at the International Level

India has contributed significantly at the international level during its freedom struggle and after its indepen-
dence. India has always opposed imperialism, colonialism and evils like racial discrimination. It has supported
movements opposing such evils. India has always remained active in the formation of the United Nations and is
actively involved in all its activities. India has played an important role by sending its military to support the
United Nation’s efforts in maintaining international peace and security. India has worked appreciably by sending
military troops to countries like Gaza, Cyprus, Congo, and Srilanka during their conflicts. India has helped ac-
tively in maintaining peace. India has persistently emphasised on the need of disarmament to achieve world
peace and security. In this issue, it has taken leadership in debates world around and in making useful sugges-
tions. India has expressed the desire of the entire humanity for peace by presenting a proposal for total nuclear
disarmament in the United Nation’s General Assembly. To spend the money in the upliftment of poor people in
other countries instead of using money in creation of nuclear weapon and military has been always been a
demand from India in the United Nations. World peace has permanently remained India’s primary concern for
its foreign policy. India has always remained active to achieve an atmosphere of co-operation, trust and under-

standing among nations.

India’s relations with other Countries

Relation between India and United States (US)

Both India and the United States are democratic countries. Apart from having lot of similarities, there has

been lot of ups and downs in the relationship also.

The United States did not like India’s role of not joining any power bloc and accepting non-aligned policy
after its independence. Further they hoped that India would join them but India joined Non- Aligned movement
for its economic growth. There is another reason that amicable relation between India and US could not grow.
That is US’s policy of favouring Pakistan. They supported Pakistan in the case of Jammu-Kashmir, Pakistan
had joined US led power and military bloc, where as India had adopted policy of Non-Alignment .Treaties
regarding nuclear weapons have become one of the most important points of disagreement between India and
United States. United States has persisted that India should sign the ‘Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty’ and
“Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty’. When India conducted nuclear test in Pokhran in Rajasthan in 1998, it was

taken seriously and certain sanctions were imposed against India as US aided financially and technically.

There is a remarkable change in relations between both countries after terrorist attack on New York’s
World Trade Centre on September 11, 2001. The United States is now accepting the fact that India is growing

economically very fast.Now , both the countries wish that there should be intimate relationship with each other.

In September 2014-15, India’s Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi visited America and even addressed the
United Nations. American President Barak Obama was the first American President to be the Chief Guest for
India's 66" Republic Day Celebration. In this way, America and India now has a cordial and amicable relation.

The issues of terrorism are concerns of the Heads of the country.
Relation between India and the Soviet Union (Russia)

The Soviet Union has helped India considerably in establishing heavy and key industries. The Soviet Union

has taken India’s side in the issue of Jammu-Kashmir. They also have often exercised their ‘veto’ power in the

United Nation’s Security Council to see that proposal against India pertaining to Jammu-Kashmir issue should

not pass. In this way, Russia and India has a very close friendly relations.
India’s relation with its Neighbouring Countries

India-Pakistan : Immediately after India’s Independence, the relation between India and Pakistan
were always stressful. Three gruesome wars took place between India and Pakistan in the year 1948, 1965 and
1971, and in all these wars Pakistan was defeated. Both the countries have Tashkent and Shimla Treaty, but
Pakistan does not follow it with utmost devotion. In 1999, Kargil war between India and Pakistan took place.
Fortunately, Heads of both the countries have expressed eagerness to resolve all issues peacefully through

negotiations.

India - China : India and China relations started in the year 1954. When China displayed its boundary
regions on map, it disturbed the relations between India and China. India opposed greatly when China showed
most of the regions belonging to India as belonging to them. The McMahon border showing the border region
between India and China was rejected by China and it led to further discomfort in the relations.
China attacked India in 1962 and captured the regions which were displayed in their map. India sent military
troops to its border regions to safeguard from China. China made a full stop to the war and in this way war
ended. To resolve these problems many meetings were held but it turned out to be futile. But in the last decades,
China and India has a co-operative and friendly relations. India’s Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi invited

Shri Jin Ping, the Prime Minister of China, to the river front, Ahmedabad, for a courtesy visit.

India - Bangladesh : Bangladesh got freedom after many struggles. In the year 1971 , Bangladesh
became an independent and sovereign country as earlier it was a part of Pakistan. As a new upcoming country,
India helped Bangladesh financially, technically and physically by giving equipment for its growth and develop-
ment. But there are certain issues which have risen between India and Bangladesh. The utilization of water
from River Ganga and its proper channelizing has been talked out between the two countries. During flood,
cyclone and other natural calamities, India has helped immensely. In 2015, concrete talks have taken place in

matters of disputed geographical land regions and the citizenship of people.

India - Bhutan : A peaceful and cordial friendship treaty had been signed between India and Bhutan in the
year 1949. Bhutan has trustfully sided India in its security and foreign policies. India assured to aid Bhutan in
telecommunication and transportation. Prime Minister Jawarharlal Nehru visited Bhutan in the year 1958 and
thereafter Indian President too had visited Bhutan in the year 1970. India helped Bhutan in becoming a member
of United Nations in the year 1971. There is never a troubled relation between India and Bhutan. India’s Prime
Minister Shri NarendraModi visited Bhutan in the year 2014 and said that India’s progress has direct effect on

its neighbouring countries. The inter-security related co-operation has been done satisfactorily.

India - Srilanka : The relation between India and Srilanka is very old. Many tamilians of India have gone
to Srilanka and settled thereafter. Their citizenship was the main issue between India and Srilanka but continu-
ous talks has resolved it. The problems of tamilians and peaceful talks between Tamil organisations and Srilankan
government was the priority of India. India’s Prime Minister Shri NarendraModi visited the troubled regions of
Tamilians in Jaffna on 13" March, 2015. India assisted financially for the reconstruction of 27,000 houses for

rehabilitation of tamilians. Today India and Srilanka have very cordial relation.

India - Nepal : The relation between India and Nepal started with the signing of Treaty in the year 1950.

ocial Science, Std. 9


--- PAGE 43 ---
According to the treaty, both countries are considered to be sovereign and to preserve regional unity as well as
commutation of citizens in both the countries. India has helped Nepal socially and economically. Nepali students
visit India for higher studies. The rivers flowing from Himalaya come from the various regions of Nepal. Due to
this, during rain it affects India badly. To stop the floods due to these rivers, talks have begun between these two
countries. On 25" April, 2015 Nepal faced a destructive earthquake of the magnitude of 7.8 on Richter scale,
which caused the death of 8000 people. India aided in Relief and Rehabilitation work in the areas affected by
earthquake.

India — Afghanistan : India has very friendly relation with Afghanistan. India has large heartedly
contributed in the reconstruction of Afghanistan like in construction, health and education. In the economic and
social development, India has financially helped. During Natural calamities also India helped financially.

The construction of Afghanistan’s parliament building is being done by India.

India - Myanmar : India and Myanmar(Burma) has very cordial relation .After India got independence
Myanmar got independence in 1948.From that time, relationship has been friendly. After independence Myanmar
has demanded financial aid from India. India has helped them instantly because India wants Myanmar to be

financially sound.

India’s foreign policy is to have world peace and security. Furthermore Indian Foreign Policy ensures
friendly and cordial relationship with its neighbouring countries. But there always has been a rise and fall in these

relations owing to various reasons

Post - Independence India

The Article for India’s Independence was passed in the British Parliament in the year 1947.According to
the Article, India and Pakistan got its existence. There were two major problems before the country:

(1) Framing the constitution of India
(2) To put an end to the sovereignty of British Empire on the Princely states and merging them into

making an intact India.
At that time, there were 562 Princely states. 48% Princely states had stakes in the total area of India. 20%

of India’s population resided in these Princely states. Kashmir, Hyderabad and Mysore were big states. Other
states were small. There were states which were too small and were

as village in form. It was a mammoth task to convince these Kings
and nawabs. Moreover, it was to be done very speedily.

After gaining Independence Maharaja of Bhavnagar, Krushna
Kumarsinh, was the first King to start responsible Government (15%
January, 1948). Bhavnagar State was merged with United Saurashtra
State, which was created due to efforts of Sardar Patel (15° Febru-
ary, 1948). The event of formation of United Saurashtra State was
described by Jawaharlal Nehru as the most notable merger in
contemporory history.

Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel appealed to the Kings and Nawabs of
the Princely states that they should voluntarily forsake their
respective states in the interest of their subjects and the Union of
India. He stimulated nationalism. Kings, Rajwadas and Nawabs con-
tributed in the making of a strong, integrated and prosperous India.

Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Sardar Patel assured them to protect their rights and interests. Sardar
Patel and his secretary of the Home Department Mr.V.P.Menon prepared the draft for ‘Attachment bond ‘and
‘Status Quo Agreement’ .Related contribution in the draft were made by committees comprising Kings and final
formation of draft was made. Kings were happy by this draft. Except Kashmir, Hyderabad and Junagadh, 559
princely states accepted this instrument of accession and joined the Union of India.

Merger of Hyderabad, Junagadh and Kashmir

Hyderabad : Nizam of Hyderabad with its states from southern part of India declared its independence on
15" of August. As far as its geographical location, it was bound to join India. But the fact was brought to their
notice that Hyderabad won’t be able to remain as an independent state as it is surrounded by Indian Territory.
The Nizam clarified the matter by saying that if the country will be divided, then owing to geographical reasons
they would not be able to join Pakistan and they would not be able to join India owing to ideological reasons.
Under such circumstances, they would prefer to remain independent. Negotiations began with the Nizam.
Sardar Patel bluntly stated to the negotiator of the Nizam that people of Hyderabad are eager to be with the
Union of India.Meanwhile the Nizam officers started committing atrocities on the people of Hyderabad.
Ultimately Hyderabad was merged with the Union of India by using ‘police force’ on 18" September 1948.Sardar
Patel assured the Nizam to protect all their interests. Kanaialal Munshi played a very crucial role in the entire
episode. After the reforming of states, the state of Hyderabad was later included in Andhra Pradesh.

Junagadh : On the day of Independence, the Nawab of Junagadh wrote an instrument of accession to join
Pakistan. Pakistan, in turn, gave them consent. Sardar Patel decided to take counter measures against this.
People of Junagadh living in Mumbai established ‘AarziHakumat’ in Mumbai. During this time, Sheikhs of
Mangrol and Manavadar declared their wish to join the Union of India. Indian soldiers and navy who were
positioned to protect Manavadar and Mangrol, besieged the Junagadh State. The Nawab of Junagadh fled

C47) Post - Independence India


--- PAGE 46 ---
to Pakistan. On 9° of November, 1947, referendum of the people of Junagadh was taken. Thus, Junagadh’s
merger with the union of India was made possible owing to Sardar Patel’s guts and tremendous will of people of

Junagadh.

Kashmir : The issue of Kashmir was the most complicated of all. Raja Harisingh of Kashmir was indeci-
sive. Meanwhile, Pakistan attacked Kashmir. Raja Harisingh requested for military assistance to protect Jammu
and Kashmir against Pakistani attack. The Government of India insisted that Raja Harisingh should first sign the
instrument of accession and then the Indian army could be sent. One of the clauses in instrument of accession
was that after restoration of normal situation in Kashmir, plebiscite would be held for permanent merger with
India. Immediately after signing the letter, the Indian army protected Kashmir. But Pakistan had already occu-
pied one third portion of Kashmir by that time. But the rest of Kashmir was saved. India has registered a
complaint against Pakistan in the Security Council of the United Nations. The Security Council suggested for
cease fire. Even today, Kashmir issue is a contentious issue in the relations between India and Pakistan. In this
way, towards the end of 1948 political unity of India was established by various historical and non-violent

movements.

Merger of French and Portuguese Colonies

India emerged as an independent and sovereign state on January 26", 1950. But certain colonies of the
French and the Portuguese rule were still under their control. Union of India appealed the French —controlled

Pondicherry and Portuguese-controlled Diu, Daman and Goa to merge with India.

People of these colonies wanted desperately to join the Union of India. They started vigorous movement
for the purpose. The French tried to suppress these freedom movements. In a mammoth meeting organised at
Pondicherry, people gave the French government the ‘Hind chhodo’ (Leave India) slogan. The Indian govern-
ment started negotiation for peaceful solution of the Pondicherry issue with the French government. But people
were not satisfied with that. In Yanam, People’s Liberation Army had taken over the administration in their
hands on June 13, 1954. The French government realised people’s rage and was compelled to start negotiation
with the Indian government. All the French colonies Karaikal, Mahe, Yanam and Chandranagar were handed
over to India for further reconstruction ( October 31", 1954). And further they were taken under Union territory

of Pondicherry.

With the reconstruction of Indian states, Pondicherry had Karaikal in Tamilnadu, Mahe in Kerala, Yanam
in Andhrapradesh and Chandranagar in West Bengal. Pondicherry is the administrative center of all these

territories.

Merger of Diu, Daman and Goa : 15" August, 1947, political leaders and Satyagrahis entered Diu, Daman
and Goa. In ‘Free Goa Agitation’ thousands of volunteers died. As attempts such as negotiation, persuasion and
Satyagrahs proved to be unsuccessful, the Indian government decided to begin ‘Operation Vijay’ to liberate Goa.
On the midnight of December 19", Governor of Portuguese, De-Silva, surrendered to Indian government. The
Indian army captured Goa, Daman and Diu and hoisted Indian flag there. Thus the last remains of the Western
rule disappeared from India. On 12"March ,1962, Goa, Dadra, Nagar Haveli, Daman, and Diu were merged
with Union of India. These states were known as Union Territories. On 30" May,1987, Daman and Diu were
separated from Goa. Thereafter ,Silvassa was made the capital of Dadra, Nagar Haveli, Daman was made the

capital of Diu and Daman and Panji was made the capital of Goa.

Formation and Reorganisation of Indian States

India became independent and acquired information about unification of princely states. Instead of accept-
ing unitary system, we had accepted union system of governance. Therefore, the issue of formation and
reorganisation of constituents of the union occurred. The erstwhile British provinces and Princely States were
divided into four divisions after their unification and merger. They are as follows :

(a) Classification of states- class A - Mumbai, Assam, Andhra, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madras,
Orissa and West Bengal were included.

(b) Classification of States - class B - Jammu-Kashmir, Hyderabad, Mysore, Central India, Rajasthan,
Saurashtra, Travancore-Cochin and Pepsu( Patiala amd East Punjab states of Union).

(c) Classification of States - class C - Ajmer, Bhopal, Coorg, Delhi, Bilaspur, Kuchch, Himachal Pradesh,
Tripura, Manipur and Vindhya Pradesh.

(d) Classification of States - class D - Andaman and Nicobar islands were included.

Interestingly, states included in all four classes did not have equal status. However, they were inseparable
parts of India. In this way, when the Constitution of India came into force, India was the Union of these
states. However, this proved to be temporary arrangement. Thereafter, a new demand of reorganisation of
states on linguistic bases started becoming strong. In 1953, Jawaharlal Nehru considered the issue of
reorganization of states and appointed State Reorganisation Commission’ .Retired Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court of India, Justice Fazal Ali was appointed as its Chairman. The other two members of the
Commission were Mr.HridaynathKunzru and Mr.K.M.Panikkar. This commission asked all the states to
submit its recommendation through various public opinions, views and through postal interaction. Above all
bilingual Mumbai state was reformed in which Maharastra, Gujarat and Saurastra were included and Mumbai
was made as the capital of this state. Finally a Bill, making changes in the Constitution and reorganising
states was passed and implemented from 1956.

The old classification of the states as class A, B, C, and D was dissolved. Amendments were made in the
first Appendix of the Indian Constitution and in place of the earlier classification, two parts were formed com-
prising of the Constituent States and Union Territories. The fourteen states included ; Andhra Pradesh, Assam,
Bihar, Mumbai , Jammu-Kashmir, Kerala , Madhya Pradesh, Madras, Mysore, Orissa , Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar
Pradesh and West Bengal. While Union territories included Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Manipur, Tripura, Andaman,
Nicobar , Lakshadweep.

Finally, Central Government made two separate states, Maharastra and Gujarat on May 1, 1960.On 25"May,
1960, recognition of Maharashtra as a state was made and its capital, Mumbai. 1“ May, 1960, is considered as
the Foundation day of Gujarat and it included the regions of Saurastra and Kutch.

Assam, Meghalaya, Manipur, Tripura, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, and Nagaland were recognized as the
‘Land of Seven Sisters’.

There was always a continuous demand for formation of separate small states from the bigger states. In
the year 2000, Jharkhand(capital-Ranchi) was separated from Bihar, Chattisgarh (capital-Raipur) was
separated from Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand (capital-Dehradun) was separated from Uttar Pradesh and
were recognised as states. In 2014, Telangana was recognised as separate state from Andhra Pradesh. Even
today, the demand for various separate states has been going on, the latest one being the Vidarbh region of
Maharashtra.

Currently, the Indian Union consists of 29 states: Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana,
Karnataka, Kerala, Jammu-Kashmir, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland,
Rajasthan, Orissa, Punjab, Tamilnadu, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Sikkim, Tripura, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh,
Uttarakhand, Arunachal Pradesh, Delhi and Jharkhand, 6 Union Territories: Chandigarh, Pundicherry,
Lakshadweep, Daman, Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and one National Capital-Delhi.

India has unity in diversity in which people following diverse religions, speaking different languages,
belonging to different castes, races and cultures have been living since centuries in this country. No other
country in the world has such diversity as India has. Cultural progress is not associated with particular caste or
creed but it’s a unified effort of people living in India.

ocial Science, Std. 9


--- PAGE 49 ---
One of the main reasons for creating the feeling of regionalism are certain greedy politicians, various commu-
nal groups who exploit the feelings of people and lure them for their motives. The people who create and instigate
regionalism are harmful elements for national unity and integrity. The aspiration for personal development is good
thought. But the one who posses danger to the society at large never aspires for overall development of a country.
Activities harming one's own state and country, should not be done. Instead, working towards one's own country is

necessary. After achieving independence, country should come first instead of state.

It becomes very obvious for people speaking common language, sharing common culture and living in
certain specific geographical region for a long time to develop emotional bondage for one another. Language,

Caste and Religion are the three main important factors for creating Regionalism.

Language : Language stimulates regionalism. North India, Hindi speakers while South India, Non-Hindi
speakers demand new regions according to languages. The States Reorganisation Commission already imple-

mented the recommendation of division of regions as per the Linguistic barriers.

Caste and Religion : People belonging to different religions live in India. Superiority of one particular
religion exists in certain regions. For example, Nagaland, Mizoram, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh have differ-
ent customs, traditions, life-style and profession. Bodo people in Assam have been demanding a different region
therefore stormy movements are taking place. ULFA terrorism is active in Assam. Punjab and Haryana sepa-
rated because of regionalism. In the same way, Jharkhand separated from Bihar, Chhattisgarh from Madhya
Pradesh and Uttaranchal from Uttar Pradesh. Currently, the demand for a separate Vidarbh region from
Maharashtra has been going on. It is not in the interest of the nation, as unity of country should be more
important than demand of one particular region. The Constitution of India declares India as a sovereign, social-
istic, secularist, democratic and republic country. During the time of reorganisation of state, regional demand

should not be the priority but unity of the country should be the main aim.
Regional Inequality

The foreign rulers did not undertake developmental activities in places where they would not get any
economic profit. As a result, there was regional inequality in such places. After independence, the Planning
Commission was formed for social and economic development of India.One of its main aim was the balanced
development of different regions. In fact, due to regional pressure, certain political reasons,the tug-of-war to
take development programmes to their own regions, the maxims for development etc. and other factors played
an important role in it. Therefore regional inequality is seen in matters of equal development. Resources of

development, grants given are the factors for regional inequality.

Even within developed, moderately developed and less developed states, internal inequality exists consider-
ably. For example, Maharashtra is in category of economically developed state. But its regions like Vidarbha and
Marathawada are backward. Certain areas of Andhra Pradesh are well developed, while areas like Rayalseema
and Telangana are considerably backward. Some regions are ahead in agricultural development while some
regions in industrial development. There are many factors between the states which are quite visible for region-
alism. There are some states who are at loggerheads for boundary issues even though they are in India. Like
between Maharashtra and Karnataka, Punjab and Haryana the boundary issues are still going on. Narrow

mindedness is seen in regions to acquire personal motive related to the flow of water and minerals, industrial raw

CL Post - Independence India

materials and agricultural sectors. This regional inequality and narrow mindedness is tremendously harmful to
the unity of the country. Means for preserving country’s dignity, superior position should be planned rather than

taking interest in regional development.

Scientific and Technological Development

India has made extra ordinary achievements in the field of science and technology in the last half century.
Looking at reasonably limited resources and less literacy, India’s growth in the field of science and technology in
comparison with other developed countries is unique. After independence , the distinguished national leaders and
scientists like , Dr.HomiBhaba, Dr. Raja Rammana, Dr.Vikram Sarabhai, Dr.C.V.Raman and in the field of
engineering Sir M.Vishwariya, Sam Pitroda, Dr.A.P.J. Abdul Kalam(India’s former President) and the creator
of the successful Metro Railway Project creator E.Shreedharan are those engineers, scientists and technocrats
who had contributed remarkably in the field of Science andTechnology. Indian Institute of Science, Indian
Institute of Technology, Indian Space Research Organisation, and Physical Research Laboratory are the glori-

ous examples. Women of India too played a noticeable role and below given is the list :

Shankuntla Devi Mathematician and (Human computer)

Women of India have contributed at large in other sectors too which brought further progress to our

country.

At the time of our Independence, we were dependent on others for food grains. In making us self-reliant
in this area, today, huge dams, lakes and canals have played a major role. We have been making use of modern
agricultural technology to increase agricultural production for the country. We have been able to achieve Green
Revolution. Agriculture institutions, laboratories and agriculture Universities have been established to achieve

growth in agricultural science.

India has indeed made a significant headway in nuclear science and technology. India has established
research institutes and laboratories for peaceful purpose of its nuclear power. Nuclear scientists and engineers
have constructed ultra-modern nuclear reactors and power stations. By successfully conducting nuclear tests

twice at Pokhran in Rajasthan we have been successful in making nuclear bombs.

India’s achievement in a very short time in space research technology is spectacular. We have developed
space shuttles Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) to launch satellites in outer space.We also
have launched satellites in outer space. Satellites like ‘Aryabhatta’(1975) , ‘Bhaskar’ (1979), ‘Rohini’ (1979) etc
are useful in successfully conducting nuclear tests, in telecasting , education, weather and getting information
about minerals through remote sensing system. In the last one decade, we have made significant progress in the
fields of telecommunication and information technology through computer, internet, mobile, smartphone, tablet,
fax, e-mail, twitter and computer whatsapp and so now India is considered in the race of developed nations.
(Application of computers is successful in administration at large mainly for indirect use in environment preser-
vation and carbon credit).

The use of Bio-technology in industries, energy, agriculture, health and the continuous research and devel-
opment in that field has resulted in the maxims like 'Digital India’ and 'Make in India’ world famous. Marine
research and continuous development, human resources development and harbour development including edu-
cation and health sectors too are continuously involved in making progress. 21* June has been declared as

“World Yoga Day’ by the United Nations, which shows the glowing future of India.

Unit 2 : Making Of Modern Nation

So far we have studied the rise of the British Empire, India’s political, social and religious move-
ments, political movements of the world in the twentieth century, two World Wars, and nationalistic spirit

prevailing in countries of Asia and Africa and about Freedom movements of India.

In this unit we are going to study about how modern India came into being. India achieved freedom
and the need for the new Constitution for governing India, soon arose. The largest, extensive and
written documentation which kept in mind the diversification of people's aspiration and expectation was
made which is known as The Constitution of India. It came into existence on 26" January, 1950 and

from that day India became the Republic Democratic country.

India a land of several languages and cultures, could best be governed on principles like democ-

racy, socialism, secularism, and ensuring integration.

To dignity the lives of human beings security of personal freedom, national stability and state

dictatorship, fundamental rights were established so that every citizen can have his/her rights.

Directive Principles were added in the policies of social, economic, political, constitutional rem-

edies so that there can be equality in the administration of state.

Government has three organs that is Legislature, Executive and Judiciary. For the perfect syn-
chronization of administration, provisions were made in the Constitution. How to administer a demo-
cratic country so that the provisions from local bodies to the Panchayati Raj further democratic process

and give fruits of democracy for which constitutional remedies were incorporated.

For the implementation of Law, protection of Fundamental Rights, a free, impartial, unified judi-
ciary is the pillar of democratic Constitution. The barometer of democracy is conducting election which
is fair, transparent and just. Every citizen is free and equal to take part in planning and administration of

democratic atmosphere. People can propose their opinions.

Politically aware citizens, keep a keen eye on the process of General Elections, Election Commis-
sion, political parties and functioning of organizations cultivating public opinion. And during elections,
they elect honest, sincere, conscientious, faithful and welfare oriented candidates. In this way, in a

democratic nation, people democratically contribute in building modern India.

Framing of Constitution and its Features

Constitution means
‘Any systematic collection of rules designed to govern a country’s regime is known as Constitution’
Importance

Constitution is the basic and most important document. The laws of the country are based on the
Constitution. The Country’s Constitution and the Constitutional laws should be subject to relevant provisions.
The Constitution is superior to all the laws of the country. Constitution involves periodically changing
requirements of the people’s aspirations, expectations, interests as well as the emotions which are high. That’s

the reason Constitution is known as a live and a basic document.
Process of Framing the Constitution

Before independence, the British Government on 25" March 1946 handed the duty to the Cabinet
Mission of three members to find a solution to the questions of India’s Independence. On the basis of
recommendation of the Cabinet Mission, the Constituent Assembly was constituted and the structure of the

Constitution was decided.

Constituent Assembly comprised 385 members in which various members from different religion, caste,
gender and people from various geographical diversification, political representatives and experts from various
sectors were included. Jawaharlal Nehru, SardarVallabbhai Patel, Maulana Abdul Kalam Azad, Shyamprasad
Mukerjee ,H.P.Modi , H.V. Kamanth , Frank Anthony, Kanaiyalal Munshi, Krishna Swami Iyer, Baldev Singh
and women representatives Sarojini Naidu, VijayLakshmi Pandit etc. were in the Constituent Assembly.
Dr.Rajendra Prasad was the President of the Constituent Assembly. A drafting committee was

appointed to draft the Constitution under the Chairmanship of Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar.

The Constitution Assembly met for 166 sessions spread over a period of 2 years, 11 months and 17 days.
Members of the Assembly has discussed threadbare, each and every detail of its provisions keeping in concern
the matters of Constitution of different countries. In this Constitution there are 295 Articles and 8 Appendices,
after ammendments with 395 Articles and 9 Appendices, the Constitution was framed. On 26" November 1949,
the Constitution was unanimously passed in the Constituent Assembly. On 26" January 1950, Constitution of
India came into existence and India was declared a ‘Republic Nation’. Thereafter every year on 26" January
we celebrate Republic Day with national fervour. In the Indian Constitution, we have four lions as ‘National
Emblem’ and national slogan ‘SatyamevJayate’ (Truth will always win). The Constitution provides for citizen-
ship, rights and duties of the people directive principles of the state policy, union-state relations, elections and

emergency provisions. Thus, the Constitution of India is the most detailed and elaborated national document.
What is Preamble ?

Preamble is the core and important part of Constitution. Indian Constitution begins with Preamble.

The words written in the Preamble highlights the soul of the Constitution.

&> Framing of Constitution and its Features


--- PAGE 56 ---
The Preamble remained unchanged till 1976. In 1976, the words ‘Socialist’, ‘Secular’, ‘Unity’ and ‘Integrity

of the Nation’ were added.

The Preamble verbalise the fundamental objectives of the Constiiution, aims, ideas and principles. There-
fore the Preamble straightway gives a clear insight of the ‘Rule of Welfare’. The Preamble reflects Constitution

framers’ psyche.
Importance of Preamble

The Preamble as a soul of the Constitution is also an important necessity. To understand the framing
of any law or its interpretation, Preamble gives proper guidance. To understand the policy behind the framing
of any law, Preamble plays an important role. The Preamble is a useful tool to avoid the trouble in the

interpretation of the Constitution.

When any ambiguity or obscure details in law arises, Preamble helps in understanding and interpreting

the law. Thus, Preamble serves as a compass to understand the provisions of Constitutional law.

Preamble is nation's unity, integrity and is the standard crust of brotherhood among citizens who are

having noble sentiments and ideals. Preamble is backed by high ideals and goals.
Pillars of the Preamble

The words inscribed in the Preamble are : We, the people of India SOVEREIGN, SOCIALIST,
SECULAR, DEMOCRATIC, REPUBLIC, JUSTICE, LIBERTY, FRATERNITY AND EQUALITY. Here

we will study the following three main pillars of the Preamble.

(1) Democracy : The ultimate sovereignty of power is with the people according to Indian constitution.

There is no particular regime of any one particular person instead it is with the people.

Democracy, the word, is derived from Greek word 'Demos' means people and ‘Kratos’ means power.
Country’s power is not within a group of people instead it is within the people of the country. Democratic
State administration is such an arrangement in which there is equal justice for people to social, economical

and political and having equal rights of participation.

In democratic India people elect their leaders through their choice by casting vote to represent those
leaders in the Parliament and thereafter assuming the post of Prime Minister and his/her Cabinet. Executives
do not have absolute power. They are given specific time-limit. Similarly, the voters elect State and Local
level Government. Hence, Democracy means by the people, for the people and of the people. Cabinet consists
members of Parliament. Cabinet of Ministers is responsible to the Parliament. Any citizen of India who
possess required Constitutional Eligibility can contest the election. Ministerial positions are not acquired
hereditary. Each elected Government has 5 years of tenure. This Government works under the principles
of Constitution and therefore it is known as ‘Responsible Government’. The democratic Government is based
on liberty, equality and feeling of fraternity and continuously work to achieve these goals. The Constitution

Social Science, Std. 9


--- PAGE 57 ---
disseminates the power to people to cast their vote according to their free will and thereby instills confidence

in the Constitution.

The Constitution of Democratic India renders Fundamental Rights, Principles for Political directions, Par-
liament, Member of Assembly, Independent and impartial justice and election commission are those provisions

which make our country democratic in every means.

Adult Suffrage means the citizen above 18 years of age can cast his/her vote to one's choice of leaders
without discriminating caste, creed, religion, language, gender, education, and income or birth place. But it is

essential that the citizens are enlisted in the Electoral list.

(2) Socialistic : In the year 1976 by 42™ Indian Constitution Ammendment, Constitution of India added
in the 42" amendment, the word ‘Socialist’. Most of the provisions in the Constitution of India directly or
indirectly show ‘Social Revolution’ which brought social and economic equality and furthered the aim of
“Welfare State’.

The principle of socialistic pattern directs social, economic and political equality for citizens as given in the
Preamble. It is now regarded as a prime feature of the State. It reflects the fact that India is committed to
secure social, economic and political justice for all its people. India stands for abolishing all forms of exploitation
as well as for securing equitable distribution of income, resources and wealth. Any one particular person should
not have power over all assets instead everyone should have equal opportunity by getting facilities and provisions
from society and thereby eliminating the discrimination of rich and poor. Therefore we can say that , Constitution

of India is a socialistic document.

(3) Secularism : In the year 1976 by 42™ Indian Constitution Ammendment the word ‘Secular’ was
inserted. India is a secular country. India can never become one particular religious country as per the
provisions of the Constituion. India does not follow any particular religion. So the country never promotes
any religious activity. The country cannot involve any secular activity with religious activity. The citizen of
the country has a freedom to choose his /her religion . The country can not discriminate a citizen on religious
basis. Equal job opportunities and political rights to the citizens are given without any religious discrimination.

In this way, Secularism is the basic foundation and mandatory feature of the Constitution.

“Sarv Dharm Samdrishti’ and “Sarv Dharm Sambhav’ are the principles incorporated in the Constitution.
So no particular religion would be encouraged in any states. There is no prohibition on any citizen to propogate

his/her religious belief, trust and faith.
Basic Features Of the Constitution

The Constitution which came into force on 26" January, 1950 is considered as the largest, extensive

and detailed written document : Given below is the basic and salient features of it:

(1) Written documet : Except Britain and Israel, India alongwith other nations of the world have their

Constitution in written form. Considering the social, geographical diversified circumstances and

pre-historical notions the Constituent Assembly has kept the drafted Constitution in written form.

(39) Framing of Constitution and its Features


--- PAGE 58 ---
(2) Size of the Constitution : Indian Constitution is divided in 22 sections comprising 395 articles
and 8 appendices (now 12) .The Constitution comprises provisions for State Administration and States’ inter
relations, fundamental rights, principles for political policies, judiciary, election commission, government
institutions, minorities, scheduled caste and deprived groups. Therefore our Constitution of India is the largest,

extensive and detailed written document, compared to other Constitutions.

(3) Single Citizenship : In America dual citizenship is given ; one for United States of America and
another for State citizenship. But in India there is only single citizenship irrespective of any region or State
of the country. Only citizens of Jammu-Kashmir have dual citizenship; one for India and another for the

state of Jammu-Kashmir.

(4) The Centre with strong Federal Structure : India is a Union of States. There is nowhere any
reference of the word ‘Federal’ in the Constitution. ‘Union of States’ is the sentence used for India.
By the use of word , Union’ , a permanent and irreversible relationship between Union and its Component
States is indicated. India is a Union of States and no State has right to secede it .Thus India is a Union
of States yet it has some elements of Federal Government. In Indian Federation, there are two sets of
Governments; the Union Government and the State Governments. The Constitution has clearly marked areas

of functioning for both the kinds of governments.

The Constitution demarcates the powers of the Central and the State governments into different Lists

of Subjects.

(i) Union List : Union List comprises 97 Subjects. Subjects of national importance like defence, foreign

affairs, atomic energy, banking, railway, communication, post and telegraph are included in the Union list.

(ii) State List : The State List comprises of 66 subjects. The State List comprises of those important
subjects on which the State Legislature House can pass Laws. Subjects like law and order, State government
institutions, agriculture and irrigation, health, land, inter-state trade and commerce are included. If there is
a failure of the law and order in the State ,the Union Government with consent or against the will of the

State can send Reserved Police Force.

(iii) Concurrent List : In addition to this, the Constitution provides for a third list that is called the
Concurrent List. which consist of subjects of common concern, both to the Centre and the State Governments.
The Central and State Government can pass laws on these Subjects. The Concurrent List has 47 subjects.
This List includes subjects like criminal and civil procedure, marriage and divorce, education, economic

planning, trade union etc.

Social Science, Std. 9


--- PAGE 59 ---
Residuary Powers
The subjects which are not specifically alloted to Union or State are included in ‘Residuary Powers’.
Matters that are not included in the division of powers are known as residuary powers. The Central

Government is given the power to legislate on these ‘residuary’ subjects.

The financial distribution of resources is done between Union Government and State Governments. excise
and custom , export-import, income tax all these major taxes are decided by Central Government while sales tax
, revenue tax , entertainment tax , educational tax which are having meagre financial resources are decided by

State Government.

(5) Unified Arrangement during crisis : There are three provisions for Emergencies in Constitution

of India.
(i) National emergency can be declared at the time of war, external attack, or armed rebellion.

(ii) Due to law and order breakdown, the State cannot function according to the Constitition, so

Constitutional Emergency is declared.
(iii) Due to increase in prices there is monetary value erosion at that, financial emergency is declared.

The Central government has been given more powers to deal with these emergencies. At the time of

emergency, India is almost turned into a unitary system.

(6) Parliamentary System : India has a parliamentary system of Governance. In a parliamentary
system, the Parliament is a supreme authority representing people. The Legislature at the Union is the
Parliament .The Parliament is bicameral means it has two houses: Upper House and Lower House. Upper
House is called RayyaSabha. Lower House is known as Loksabha. Though the Government is carried on
in the name of the President at the Union and the Governor in the States, actual administration is carried
by the Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister at the Union and the Chief Minister in the States.
The Council of Ministers is responsible to the Legislature that comprises representatives of the people. The
President selects 12 people who are experts and experienced from various fields for RajyaSabha. RajyaSabha
is permanent house in which one-third members retire every two years the same number of member for
election. Thus each member has six years of tenure in RajyaSabha (Council of States). The powers of
RajyaSabha are less compared to the LokSabha which is special, superior and decisive. Rajyasabha cannot

be completly dissolved.

(7) Independent and Impartial Judiciary : The Constitution has provided for the establishment of
an independent and impartial judiciary. There is Supreme Court at the top, then there are High courts at
states and under its jurisdication are the District Courts at district level and at the taluka level there are
Local and Special courts. The Judgements of Supreme Court are binding to all the sub-ordinate Courts of
the Nations. In case of conflict between the Unoin and State Governments, matters relating to Constitution
and interpretation of Statutes, the final decision is vested with Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is the

Cot) Framing of Constitution and its Features


--- PAGE 60 ---
(8) Amendments in Constitution : Compared to other countries’ Constitution, Constitution of India
is dynamic. Constitution can be amended as and when required. Constitutional provisions can be amended

three ways :
(i) Amendments can be made by a simple majority of members present and voting in the Parliament.

(ii) Certain amendments require a special majority, that is 5 (two-third) majority of members present

and voting.

(iii) Concerning the Union-State relations, the special majority that is < (two-third) and the concurrence

not less than 50% of the State Legislature is required.

If there is any amendment to be made in the inter-relations between Union, State structure of or in
supreme judiciary, then half of the States from the total States have to give consent. Judgement of Court
can also bring amendment by the Parliament. There will be no change in the basic structure of the Constitution.
Simple majority in Parliament can bring change in the amendments of the Constitution, that’s why the
Constitution is known as the most inconstant and flexible document but at certain cases it is not amendable
by simple majority. Without the majority consent of states its not amendable .. Then too the mixture of both

makes the Constitution.

(9) Universal Adult Suffrage : In India, we have a system of Adult Suffrage which is flexible.
According to that any citizen who is above 18 years of age and above possesses right to vote in the elections
of Parliament, Legislative Assemblies or Local Self-Government Bodies, without any discrimination of

education, property and economic standard.

(10) Secularism : We have discussed earlier about secularism in the Preamble. In the Constitution
India has been declared as a secular state. People of different religions reside in India. Therefore the State
cannot discriminate any citizen on the basis of religion. No citizen can be given special rights or cannot be
deprived with certain rights. The State has to be absolutely impartial and neutral in respect of religion. Only
secular state can offer proper or equal treatment towards all citizens. Secularism means that the state doesn’t
interfere in matters of religion, or is biased to any specific religion. The State has to be secular and indifferent.

Followers of every religion are free to follow and practice their religion of choice.

(11) Judicial review : Judicial review is the chief characteristic of the Constitution. Judicial review
administers the working of Union and State within jurisdiction. Without disrespecting the powers of Parliament,
the Constitution has made an effort to harmonize the principles of judocial review. Parliamentary amendments,
external orders, ordinances, and judicial judgement are given for Judicial Review. If the court finds any
indiscrepancy in the external orders, ordinances or judicial judgements it can stopped by declaring them

unconstitutional.

(12) Fundamental Rights and Duties : Fundamental rights are conferred to the people of India by
the Constitution to live a dignified life. The most valuable capital of our country is in the overal] development
of nation which further lies in the Fundamental Duties and Rights. Right to Constitutional Remedies and for
the children 6 to 14 yerars of age Right to Educate are also made available.

(13) Directive Principles of State Policy : Protection of people, security and welfare should be carried

out by the States. These principles provide directions for State governances and policy making, so they are

called as Directive Principle.

(14) Provision for Backward sections and Tribes : To uplift and include backward sections and

tribes and deprieved class in the main stream, there are specific provisions in the Constitution. Reserve seats
are allocated in Legislature and Local Self Governing Bodies election to provide representation. Reservation
Quota has been provided for admission in educational institutes and government jobs in proportion to their
population to provide equal apportunity. Children of backward sections and tribes are given scholarships, basic
amenities and waivered fees which come under ‘optimistic policies’ and ‘shielding policies’ as per provision

in the Constitution.

Introduction

In the previous chapter we have studied Indian Constitution, Preamble and Important Pillars as well as the
specific characteristics .In this Chapter,we will study about other important characteristics of Constitution that is
Fundamental Rights, Fundamental Duties and Directive Principles of State Policy.

Human Rights

Human Rights are those rights which not only give a person his/her basic existence but also overall devel-
opment in which society helps to construct an environment which enables him/her to grow. In every democratic
country, the citizens are conferred with basic rights. A person is not discriminated on the basis of caste, can
experience the basic rights, the protection of these rights are assured by society and nation as well. The person
by his birth, owns rights, which are his /her basic rights which are known as Human Rights.

United Nations General Assembly has declared Human Rights on 10" of December, 1948 and 10"
December is celebrated as ‘Human Rights Day’. From the global announcement of Human Rights, certain
basic and important Human rights are added in the Constitution of India and thereby these rights are protected
in a dignified way. Thus, those Human Rights which are included by Constitution of India are known as
Fundamental Rights.

These Human rights proclaim the human beings to live in a dignified way. For the existence of human being
the basic needs (Food, Clothes, Shelter, Education and Health) should be received in a dignified and respectable
way. Democratic country allows its citizens to enjoy equal rights for multifaceted development. The State
gurantees such a conducive environment wherein one has protection of Fundamental Rights,a true identity of
democratic system.

Fundamental Rights

The nation’s stability, protection of citizen’s freedom and democracy are protected through fundamental
rights :

(1) Right to Equality (2) Right to Freedom (3) Right against Exploitation (4) Right to Freedom of Religion
(5) Cultural and Educational Rights (6) Right to Constitutional Remedies.

(1) Right to Equality : ‘Equality before Law’ and ‘Equal protection of Law’ are included in Right
to Equality. This fundamental right is the major foundation of all other rights and privileges guaranteed to
Indian citizens. It is one of the chief guarantees of the Constitution of India. Thus, it is imperative that every
citizen of India has easy access to the courts to exercise his/her Right to Equality. According to this Right,
no person shall be shown favouritism on the basis of colour, caste, creed, language, etc. Law is equal to
all ,i.e., from the peon to the Prime Minister if they act against Law , they are treated equally and are bound
to the general court of Law. However, the President and Governers have certain previleges..

In each and every circumstance the Law should prevail equally. There should be no discrimination or
specific favouritism shown to any particular person or class. Every Law should be equally disseminated.Every
person shall have equal admittance to public places like shops, restaurants, hotels, public entertainment places,
have equal access to roads and lakes and use of public wells and bathing ghats. However, the State has the right
to make any special arrangement for women and children or for the development of any socially or educationally
backward class or scheduled castes or scheduled tribes. No citizen shall be discriminated on the basis of race,
caste, religion, creed, descent or place of birth in respect of any Government services and higher education
under the State. In matters of state public services equal opportunities have to be offered to all the citizens.
However, the state is given permissin to make decision regarding/ required qualifications for said services.

AS a guarantee to social justice and personal dignity, untouchability is abolished and its practice in any form
is prohibited and a punishable offence.

Titles and epithets which create artificial discriminations in the society have been removed. The adjectives
used before names like Sir, Diwanji, Raibhadur are removed. After independence the Government in order to
felicitate special contributions and achievements of individuals in various ficlds gives special awards like
Bharatratna, Padmavibushan, Padmabhushan, Padmashree. 'Paramveer Chatra’ is awarded in military ser-
vices. Adjectives like General, Major, Chief Marshall, Field Marshall are added before names in military services
which is not considered as a violation of Right to Equality. The aim of this Right is to form an equitable society
and thereby establish 'Rule of Law' in india.

To provide specific services to different types of groups or classes, there can be different types of
provisions under law for examples, there are differant laws for Advocates, Doctors, Teachers, Insurance
Agencies, Women, Juveniles. The principle of 'Equal Pay for Equal work’ is also a part of this article.

business.

These rights are of utmost importance for the overall development of personality and expressions of
Indian Citzens, for harmonious working of democracy, and a healthy life-style. Any individnal connot exercise
these freedom autonomously or irresponsibly. The State can control and limit this right to freedom if they
go against the welfare, peace and security of the society. This has been clearly mentioned in the Constitution

It has been stated in the Constitution how the nghts are exercised.

Indian citizens have been given the Freedom of Speech and Expression. This can be expressed either
orally, verbally and through gestures. but that does not provide for exercising these rights in unlimited and
unrestained manner. Certain necessary control and limitation have been stated in the Constitution. The State
can put required control through law and order for maintaining the unity and integrity of India, safety of
the state, for amicable relation with foreigh nations, public management and public peace, compromise and
safety, morality, discipline, contempt of court defamation and provoking violence for crime. It is the authority
of the Judiciary whether these many limitations are appropriate or inapporipriate. The purpose behind the
freedom of Press through which ideas and opnions put forth for public welfare has not been separately

mentioned. It can be included in the Right to Expression.

The latest amendment of 2009 in Constitution of India confers Free and Compulsory Primary Education
for the children between 6 to 14 years. If a person is not convicted for a crime, then he cannot be sentenced
to punishment or more punishment than the one prescribed by the law, cannot be given the punishment more

in custody. As per the Prohibition Act, the person under arrest will not be applicable to the aforesaid matters.

Preventive Detention: If the State anticipates any criminal deed or activity from any person then as
a precautionary measure that person can be detained by the State under an Preventive Detention Act. .
The purpose of this Act is not to punish a convict, but to stop him from doing any criminal activity against
State, Society or any individnal. Under this Act, a person can be detained not more than 3 months. The
Detention or order can be cancelled based on the opinion of the Judges of Superme Court or Members of

the Advisory Board. The State can decide the term of detention.

(3) Right Against Exploitation : The main objective of the Constitution is to see any person does
not suffer exploitation at the hands of other person and exploitation free society is established. That is objective
of the Constitution through this Right. Human Trafficking, drudgery, slavery and forced labour are banned.
The violation of this Right is a punishable offence. [legal trade of children and women, forced labour or
imposed slavery, work without pay and the old drudgery system has to be ended through this right. To take
work from any person without paying them or paying them less than minimum wages, forced or imposed
labour is a punishable act.

But this right is to be enjoyed within permissable limits so that it does not affect the freedom of public
Administration, Morality and Health of the society. The religious gatherings, offerings or prayers are not
included in this.

The State of India does not have any religion of its own or the Indian State is not run as per the principles
of any religion or sect. The State cannot interfere in the religious matters or religious beliefs of any group.
The religious groups have been given the freedom to establish any religious organisation and can manage
and administer them for religious and philanthropic aims. The State cannot use the funds collected through
public taxes or public fund for the benefit and development of any specific religious and sect. The Educational
Institution running on Government Grant cannot impart religious education or compel the students to participate

Any educational institution which rely on the Government Grant cannot deny admission on the grounds of
religion, caste, creed, language or any other reason.

If any individual appeals to vote on the grounds of religion, caste or language then it is considered as
a malpractise as per Act 123 (3). Any of the State can frame a law and provide the right to its citizen to
form and manage any of the educational institute based on cultural or lingustic minority. The State shall not

institutions then it can do so only after giving proper returns. In this way, important provisions in context
of Education Institution have been made in the Constitution.

(6) Right to Constitutional Remedies : No matter, how many laws are framed or how many
provisions are made for the Fundamental Rights if these are not implemented well, then there remains no
meaning of such freedom or right. Therefore, a provision has been made in the Constitution for the
implementation of these rights and under it , a writ in the Supreme Court can be made for the violation of
the Fundamental Right .This Right has been accepted as the Right to Constitutional Remedies. The Supreme
Court plays an important role in protecting the Fundamental Rights. And for this, if the Court finds it necessary
then it can give orders, instruction or decree. The Apex Court is vested with the powers given by the
Constitution. Nobody can oppose it, if any person puts a complain against any State for the vlolation of any

Fundamental Right then the Supreme Court can exercise its right.

Dr.Babasaheb Ambedkar has considered this right as ‘Soul of the Constitution’. The Parliament can hand
over the powers of giving such an order to any of the court. If the State Legislative Assembly frames any Law
which violates the Fundamental Rights or not in Congruence of it then the Supreme Court can stop the State.
Thus, this Right provides an opportunity to any of the citizen to approach court for the violation of Fundamental

Rights.

The Constitution provides the Fundamental Rights to the Indian Citizens. These Rights are given against
the Governments. (Centre And State). The Funda mental Rights are applicable to all this citizens at all the times,
but can be suspended during the time of Emergency. Any State cannot form any laws which take away the

Fundamental Rights of these citizens.
Fundamental Duties

The people of India were more aware of their Rights and Duties since ancient times. Just as the citizens
are given various Fundamental Rights, various Fundamental Duties were incorporated by Constitutional
amendment in 1976. The Fundamental Duty aims to inculcate love for nation, national integrity, various high
ideals and value awareness among its citizens. Thereby helping in developing the nation. Every citizen of India
should contribute towards the protection of Nation's unity, integrity and sovereignty, so that there remains peace,

by the law. The person violating it, can be sentenced. A teacher should make efforts so that the students follow
the Duties and they become aware and conscientious. It is our Duty and Responsibility as a citizen to see that
various social evils and customs prevailing in the society should be eradicated like untouchability, drudgery, child-
labour, women exploitation, dowry, female-foeticide, ill-customs, superstition. These Duties are directive in con-
veying us that what as a sensible and aware citizen must do. If citizen propogates the importance and utilization
of Fundamental Duties then future citizens develop the feeling of national responsibility, international brother-
hood, just and exploitation free society.
Directive Principles of State Policy

Directive Principles of the State have been incorporated in the Chapter-IV of the Constitution. The objec-
tive of the Directive Principles of State Policy is to guide the present and future, Centre and State Governments
in the Policy-making in various policy related field. These Principles are Directive. The State is not bound to
fulfill them. But its the moral responsibility of the State to keep these principles in the Centre for framing any
policy. The main objective of this principle is to see that any political, social and economic justice should be
available to all, Such a social structure should be established. For the fulfillment of the objectives and aims of the
State, the Principle serve as a guideline. There is no provision in the Constitution to implement these Principles
of law. These Fundamental Principles do not provide any legal support or legal right. Then also the framing and
administering the laws of the States these are Fundamentals. Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, "To rule the regime
these principles are the foundations.” It means an attempt to establish political democracy in our Constitution.
Political Democracy is incomplete without social and economical democracy.

The Indian Constitution has included Directive Principles of State Policy in the four sections of the Amend-
ment. The kind of country that we want to create, the kind of society we want to construct, that vision is
reflected in these Directive Policies. The Directive principles are actually directions given by the Constitution to
the Union and State governments to adopt such policies that would help to establish an unbiased society in our
country.

The primary aim of these principles is to establish a social system based on social, economic and political
justice.These Principles are about the implementation of the objectives and ideals presented in the Preamble.
These principles are not included in the Constitution of India. These Principles do not serve legal rights or legal
backing or legal utilization. For proper administration of the State, these principles are channelized. These
principles incorporate such rights as are required for the overall development of mankind.

These Directive Principles are divided into various sections.

(iv) Hygienic environment should be maintained in the working areas of labourers. They should have

social and cultural development at the time of leisure. Entertainment provision should be there to

maintain mental health. These provisions should be kept in concern by the state.

Thus, these principles provide guidance to the state to take lead towards establishment of equal, just and

social order without any exploitation. The Directive Principles envisage future society, they guide us to the

directions that we should go and lead us to our destination. The upliftment of society and protection of society

will be taken care by the State. Fundamental Rights limit the State leadership while Directive Principles extend

state leadership. Fundamental rights make the existence of Democracy, while Directive Principles of society

and finance imparts aims for inter-relation of democracy. There is no opposition between them. Both of them

complete each other.

Organs of Government

There are three organs of the government. The Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary. We shall
study in detail the formation of all these three organs of the Government, their powers, their functions and
their interpersonal relations.

One of the main objectives of the nation is to maintain law and order and thereby achieve the welfare
of the nation, and at the same time to nurture and to protect the freedom and fundamental rights of the
citizens. For the progressive development of the state it is necessary that all the three organs of the
Government viz the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary work in mutual unity, co-operation and co-
ordination, so that the Government can run its administration effectively and efficiently. The Legislature
frames the laws, the Executive implements the framed laws and the Judiciary maintains law and order by
punishing the people who violate the law.

The Legistature as per the Constitution of India consists of a Parliament at the Centre and Legislative
Assemblies at the State level. The Executive as per the Constitution of India consists of the President, the
Prime Minister and Cabinet Minister and their administrative system at the centre and the Governor, the
Chief Minister and his cabinet and administrative system at the State level. Whereas in the Judiciary the
Supreme court is at the top, in the middle are the High courts of the States and at the bottom there are
Subordinate courts, District courts and Special courts. Thus the Judiciary is a separate, independent and
organized whole, which is completely apart from the Legislature and the Executive.

India is a Union of States. No State is completely independent and sovereign. The Indian parliamentary
system has divided the powers according to the principle of division of powers between the Centre and the
State such that the Legislature and the Executive is totally interdependent on each other. Whereas the
Judiciary is separate, independent and impartial organ.

The Principle of Division of Power

The Government carries out the functions of the states and these are different from one another. The
function of all the three organs of the goverment are different and all the functions require a certain expertise.
All the three organs of the Goverment should be administered by different people and each organ should
carry out its own functions. By division of powers misuse can be avoided. It is necessary to divide the
powers between the three organs of the Goverment in order to make the function of the Goverment easy
and efficient. For example, the Legislature has the power to formulate laws but some powers are so given
to the Executive and the Judiciary that the Legislature cannot misuse its powers. Similarly the Executive
is controlled by giving powers to the Legislature and the Judiciary and the Judiciary is controlled by giving
powers to the Legislature and the Executive.

(1) Legislature : India is a republic having a parliamentary democracy. The representation of the
people at the centre is seen at the Parliament and of the state is seen in the Legislative Assembly. The
Parliament is an important and apex organization of the nation. The Indian Parliament consists of the President,
the Vice-President, Rajyasabha and Loksabha. Legislature is of two types :

(A) Unicameral Legislature : When the legislature is consisting of one house, it is called Unicameral
Legislature.

(B) Bicameral Legislature : When the legislature is consisting of two houses, it is called Bicameral
Legislature.

At the Central level, the Upper House of the Legislature is called the Rajya Sabha and the Lower
House is called the Lok Sabha. At the State level, the Legislature consists of the Legislative Assembly and
the Legislative Council. Most of the States have only Legislative Assembly. States like Bihar, UttarPradesh

and Maharastra have Legistative Councils too.

C8) Organs of Government


--- PAGE 72 ---
(1) Legislature at the Central Level - Parliament - Loksabha : Loksabha is the Lower House
of the Parliament. The members of the Loksabha are the representatives of the people who are elected
through direct election. There are in all 545 Members of the Loksabha. Out of the 545 members, 2 members
are selected by the President from the Anglo-Indian community.

President is a part of the Parliament (Loksabha and Rajyasabha). The President addresses the first
meeting of the Parliament and the joint session of the Parliament. Besides these two occassions, the President
never attends the Parliament. The President can summon both the Houses of the Parliament, can withhold
the proceedings of both the Houses of the Parliament and can even dissolve the Parliament. A Bill which
has passed through three readings in both the houses of the Parliament can become an Act only after the
President signs it. Loksabha is not a Permanent House Its term is of five years. If it is not dissolved before
the completion of the term.

Constitution of India is supreme and not the Parliament. Hence ,the Parliament has to enjoy its power
within the limits prescribed by the Constitution. If the laws framed by the Parliament violates the Constitution,
they can be challenged in the court. If the court finds the framed laws against the provision of the Constitution
the court can nullify the laws.

Qualification for membership of Loksabha : To be qualified as a candidate and to be elected as

Government. He must not be a proven criminal. There should be a period of six months between two sittings
of the Parliament. A President can dissolve the Loksabha on the counsel of the Prime Minister. A member
of any of the House of the Parliament can attend the proceeding of that House and can vote in the same
House, but a member of the Cabinet Ministry can attend the proceedings of both the Houses of the Parliament
even if he/she is not a member of the Loksabha, but if he/she is a member of the Upper House then he/
she can vote in that House only. State of Gujarat has a representation of 26 members in the Loksabha.
The term of Loksabha is of 5 years, but the President can dissolve it before that if needed. In case of national
emergency the term of the Loksabha can be extended for 1 more year. If the President dissolves the
Parliament it cannot be challenged in court.

Quorum : Quorum is the number of members present in the House of the Pparliament. It is the number
of members present and working in the House out of the total number of members of that House. The

1
minimum corum of the Loksabha should be Th i.e. out of 545 members, 55 should be present similarly

the minimum corum of the Rajyasabha too should be TT i.e out of 250 members, 25 should be present.

(2) Rajyasabha : Rajyasabha is the Upper House of the Parliament. It is a representative house of
all the states and Union territories of India. There are in all 250 members in the Rajyasabha. The members
of the Rajyasabha are indireclty elected by the members of the Legislative Assemblies of the state and the
Union territories through a method of equivalent representation. In all 238 members of the Rajyasabha are
elected. Rest 12 members are nominated by the President of India. These nominated members should be
having special knowledge or parctical experience with respect to literature, science, arts, culture, sports and

every two years and the same number of members are elected. Thus the tenure of the member of the

Rayyasabha is of 6 years. Howover ,the members are eligible for re-election and re-nomination.

Generally both the Houses of the Parliament, meets for three times a year. These meetings are called
sessions. That is the Budget Session, Monsoon Session and the Winter Session. The Vice President of India
by virtue or his office, helds the office or Chairman of Rajyasabha. Whereas the Vice Chairman of the
Rajyasabha is elected by the members of the Rajyasabha from among themselves only. The frist Chairman
of the Rajyasabha was Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan.

The speaker of Loksabha

The main function of the speaker is to see that the proceedings of the Loksabha gets organised in a
prescribed form, to maintain discipline, order and dignity of the Houses are the top most functions of the
Speaker. The members of the Loksabha elect their Speaker and Deputy Speaker from among themselves.
The Speaker presides over the Session of the Loksabha and maintains and controls it's functioning. The
Speaker expects discipline from the members in the Loksabha. The Speaker is the protector of the dignity
of the House. His decisions in the House are final and conclusive.

Speaker can belong to any of the political party or can even have a strong support of any political party;
but after being appointed as the Speaker of the Loksabha it is expected that the Speaker carries out the
proceedings of the Parliament in a firm and impartial manner. By gaining a majority of the members of the
Loksabha on a resolution to remove the Speaker, with this a Speaker can be removed from his post by giving
a 14 days notice period. All the speeches and criticism in the Loksabha is done by addressing the Speaker
only. The working in both the Houses of the Parliament can be carried out in either Hindi or English. But
a Speaker can permit any member of the Loksabha to speak in his own language in case he does not know
English or Hindi. If any member of the Loksabha remains absent for a continuous period of 60 days without
informing the Speaker then his seat is declared as vacant.

Casting Vote : During any proceedings of the house there arises any question, matter or problem,
or discussion on any Bill or Act; and decision upon it is to be taken especially when the number of votes
in favour or against the matter are equal in number then in such condition, the Speaker can give his deciding
vote which is known as ‘Casting vote’. Apart from such situations the speaker cannot vote. Shri Ganesh
Vasudev Mavlankar was the first speaker of Loksabha.

In the absence of the speaker, the proceedings are conducted out by the Deputy Speaker. In the absense
of the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker, the proceedings of the Loksabha are conducted by a ‘Speaker's
Panel’ consisting of senior, experienced and who are familiar with the proceedings of the Parliament experts
from different political parties.

When can a Bill Become an Act ?
The Proposal is called a Bill

The Parliament does the important work of augmenting the old laws, framing new laws and nullifying
obsolete laws. Any of the Bills either Ordinary Bill, Money Bill or the Bill to amend Constitution can become
an Act by passing through the following process. Any Bill can be presented in either House of the Parliament.
The Bill can be presented by a minister or any member of the Parliament. If any dispute arises between
the two Houses of the Parliament regarding any Bill, the President can call a joint sitting of both the Houses
of the Parliament. The proceedings of both the Houses of the Parliament in a joint sitting is chaired by the
Speaker, wherein the Bill can be passed by majority. Then the Bill becomes an Act if it is passed by a Majority

of the members of both the Houses.

C15) Organs of Government


--- PAGE 74 ---
(1) Procedure of an Act from Bill-Ordinary Bill (Non-Financial) : The procedure of presenting
a Bill in the House of the Parliament by Minister is called first reading of the Bill, where in the title, objectives
and the reasons of the Bill are described. Before presenting any Bill in the State Legislature Assembly the
recommendation of the Chairman of the House and before presenting any Bill in the centre the
recommendation of the President is required. In the first reading of the Bill the general information of the

Bill is discussed upon. Objections must be with reasons and voting is done if necessary.

Section wise discussion is done for every point. Its objectives and its repurcusions are examined.
Amendments are done in it on the basis of public, groups, association, institutions or opinion of the opposition

Party. Voting is carried out on that.

Sometimes due to the work load of the House a Bill cannot be discussed in detail. Therefore it is handed
over to a committee comprising of subject experts and members having special knowlodge to examine the
Bill. Then keeping in view the public opinion they undergo necessary discussion and suggest required
changes therein. The report of the committe is submitted to the House. Then the Bill is sent for the third
reading.

The third reading is only formal. After presenting the logic in terms of acceptance or rejection of the
changes in the Bill, voting is carried out. If it gains majority then the Bill is declared passed. The passed
Bill is signed by the Chairman of the first House and then it is sent to the second House. The Bill goes
through the same process in second House. If the Bill passes in the second House with its necessary
amendments, it is sent to the President's signature and after receiving President's assent the Bill becomes

an Act.

But if the Bill is not passed in the second House of the Parliament, it is again sent to the first House.
If the second House keeps the Bill for more than six months, it is understood that Bill is rejected. If both
the Houses disagree or have a dispute over a Bill, a joint session of both the Houses is summoned. In the

joint session of the Parliament the disputes are tried to be resolved through gaining majority..

When a Bill is sent for President's signature, there are three options with the President :

(1) He signs the Bill thereby approving it or

(2) He keeps the Bill with him or

(3) He sends the Bill back to the Parliament for reconsideration.

The Bill becomes an Act is published in Government gazzette, then there is enforcement from the date
given therein.

(B) When any Bill to amend the Consitution is presented in any of the House of Parliament it has to
be passed by a majority number of the members of that house and by 2/3" of the members present and
voting. If a bill pertains to any matter related to the Centre or the State, it requires permission of
more than half the Legislative Assemblies of the States. This bill also goes through the same process as
the Ordinary Bill.

(C) Procedure Subject to Money Bill : Whether the Bill is Money Bill or not is decided by the Speaker
of the Loksabha. A Bill containing the recommendations of the budget or financial matters is called a Money
Bill. The budget of the Centre is presented around 28th February in the Loksabha mostly by the Finance

ocial Science, Std. 9


--- PAGE 75 ---
Minister. All the Money Bills are first presented in the Loksabha which passes through the following process.

(i) A preliminary discussion is carried out on the Money Bill presented in the Loksabha.

(ii) The expenses mentioned in the budget are discussed upon. The finance minister presents all the
numeric details of the budget in the Parliament.

(ii) All the ministers like Agriculture, Science, Defence, Trade Business and Human Resource
Department etc. puts forth their demands in front of the Loksabha and then the voting is carried
out to get permission of demands.

(iv) Soures of income and taxes are separately presented in the budget and both are to be separately
approved.

The Bill approved in the Loksabha first is sent to the Rayyasabha for recommendations. The Rajyasabha
has to return it to the Loksabha with necessary recommendations within 14 days. Loksabha can either accept
or reject the total or partial recommendations of the Rajyasabha. If a Money Bill is not return to the Loksabha
within 14 days by the Rajyasabha, the Bill is considered to have been passed by the Rajyasabha. If the
Loksabha accepts the recommendations of the Rajyasabha, the Bill is considered to have been passed by
both the Houses of the parliament. But if the Loksabha rejects the recommendation of the Rajyyasabha and
the Bill is again passed in the Loksabha, the Money Bill is deemed to have been passed by both the Houses
of the Parliament. Hence, in the matter of the Money Bill the Rajyasabha has limited powers.

After the Money Bill is passed by both the Houses of the Parliament, it is sent to the President for
his assent. The President has to sign the Money Bill. If the budget is not passed in the house then the
government has to resign.

Apart from this in both the houses of the Parliament the social, economic, political, defence and foreign
matters are discussed. The Loksabha monitors and controls the workings of Executive, Cabinet of Ministers
and the Bureaucrats. It is the work of the elected members to see that the funds of the public are utilized
properly. Loksabha has a direct control over the use of public funds. Without the consent of the houses of
the Parliament no new taxes can be levied or any improvment in the existing taxes can be done. The Houses
of the Partiament are called as the custodians of public funds as it controls the functioning of the Executive.
Besides this the Parliament has the power to remove President, Vice President, Chief justice of the
Supreme Court as well as the High court, Chief Election Commission, Auditor General or Attorney General
under the charge of proven misbehaviour or inefficiency or violation of the Constitution, through the process
of Impeachment.

Legislature at the State Level

(A) Legislative Assembly : Each State has a Legislature and it is called Legislative Assembly.
Legislative Assembly is the Lower House.

(B) Legislative Council : The other House of the Legislature is called the Legislative Council. Bihar,
Maharastra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu etc. States have two Houses. There the Legislative
Council is the Upper House and the Legislative Assembly is the Lower House. Gujarat State does not have
a Legislative Council.

Various States have different numbers of members of the Legislative Assembly. As per the provision
in the constitution the minimum number of members of Legislative Assembly is 60 and the Maximum number
of members is 500. The number of members of Gujarat Legislative Assembly is presently 182.

Qualification for membership of the State Legislature : Any person who is a citizen of India and
is of 25 years or more and is not in a State of unsound mind, insolvent or criminal can contest the elections
of Legislative Assembly.

Time Period : The Legislative Assembly is not a permanent House. Its time period is of 5 years. After
the given period the Legislative Assembly is dissolved. In unusual situations, wherein the Government cannot
function as per constitutional provision or if Government cannot be formed then the Governor can send a
recommendation to the President of India to dissolve the Government. The President then dissolves the
Legislative Assembly and imposes ‘President Rule’ in that State. During that time period the Governor

--- PAGE 76 ---
administers the State. For the purpase of smooth functioning of the Legislative Assembly Speaker and Deputy
Speaker are elected by the members from amongst themselves.

Governance, registered graduates, teachers of secondary and higher secondary by electorates. To be eligible
as a member of the Legislative Council, the candidate should be of 30 years or more and must be a citizen
of India. The Legislative Council is a permanent House. Like the Rajyasabha each of its members gets elected
for a term of 6 years. Its 2/3rd members retire every 2 years. A State has to decide whether to keep a Legislative
Council or not. Gujarat does not have a Legislative Council. Like the Loksabha the Legislative Assembly has
more power. Ordinary as well as Money Bills can be presented in it. After the Bills pass through various steps
they are sent to the Governor for his assent. After the Governor signs the Bill it becomes an Act.

(2) Executive : The most efficient effective and central organ of the Government is the Executive.
Union Executive means at Central Government, Political, Excutive comprising Administration of the Prime
Minister and Cabinet of Ministers, President, Vice-President and Bureaucrats. Political and Administrative
Executive officers and employees are in direct contact of the people. The people are influenced by their
work. The Executive implements the laws framed by the Legislature. The administrative executive carries
out the work of implementing the policies, programmes and planning done by the Government keeping in

view the aspiration and expectation of the people.

The Political Executive changes every five years or if the power is given up. Whereas the administrative
executive is formed by permanently appointed bureaucrats and hence it is permanent. However the retirement
age of the Administrative Bureaucrats is different in different states. Before their retirement, if they
misbehave, or shows lack of efficiency to work, they can be removed from their post after following
prescribed inquiry procedure. The Political Executives are the members belonging to any political party. Their
main qualification is to get elected based on their individual honesty to the party, public choice and public
opinion whereas Administrative Executive requires educational qualifications, quality, experience as well as
passing competitive examination to be appointed permanently. The service of the administrative officers is
known as the Civil Service. At the Centre, the Political Executive consists of President, Vice President, Prime
Minister and Cabinet of Ministers as per the Constitution.

President

President is the Constitutional Head of India. All the executive powers of the federal Government is
given to the President by the Constitution. All the administration of the Central government is carried out

in the name of the President. He is the Head of the nation and the first citizen of Republic of India.

Qualification : A Presidential candidate should be a citizen of India and should be 35 years of age
or above. He should not be a salaried employee of the Government or hold any office of profit. He should
not be a member of any of the Houses of the Parliament or State Legislative Assembly. The Presidential
election is indirectly carried out by the members of both the Houses of the Parliament and the members
elected to the State Legislative Assembly. A President is elected for a term of 5 years and he can contest
the election after the completion of his term. When the President is in power neither criminal case can be

framed against him nor an order of arrest or improvment can be issued..

Functions and Powers : He appoints the leader of the party who has gained majority in the general
election as the Prime Minister. Then with the consultation of the Prime minister, he appoints the other ministers
of the cabinet. He administers the oath and distributes the portfolios to the ministers. As long as the cabinet
enjoys the support of the majority members of Loksabha the President cannot dissolve the cabinet. President

ocial Science, Std. 9


--- PAGE 77 ---
prorogues them. He can even dissolve the Loksabha. If the President is satisfied that the security of India
or any part of its territory is threatened by a war or external aggression or armed rebellion, he can declare
a state of emergency for the whole of India or any of its parts. The declaration of emergency cannot be
challenged in court. Based on report of the Governor the President can declare Constitutional Emergency
in that state. He can establish ‘President rule’ by dissolving the State Cabinet Ministry. In case of financial
emergency the President can reduce salaries of all government officials, including Judges of the Supreme
Court and the High court. Though the President has vast executive and administrative powers and though
all the administration can be considered in the hands of the President only and done in his name only, in
reality, the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers enjoy these powers.

The Vice President

In the absence of the President, the Vice President performs the functions of the President. The
Vice Presidential election is carried out by the members of both the Houses of the Parliament. The term
period of the Vice President is of 5 years. The Vice President is the Chairman of the Rajyasabha. The
President submits his resignation to the Vice President.

Prime Minister

The Prime Minister is the real head of the Central Government. The Prime Minister is the head of
the party who has achieved a majority in the general elections. He is appointed formally by the President.
The Ministers to the Cabinet are appointed as per the counsel of the Prime Minister. He distributes the
portfolios. Any Minister either to be taken, left or continued in the cabinet is decided by the Prime Minister.
He presides over the meetings of the Cabinet and also looks after the functioning of various departments
of the cabinet. He takes pivotal decisions. The Prime Minister is the head of the Planning Commission which
is now known as Policy Commission. There are three level of ministers under the Prime Minister. The Cabinet
Ministers, the State Ministers and the Deputy Ministers. The Prime Minister should be a member of any
one House of the Parliament. The Ministers are individually responsible for their Ministries and departments.
The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible and accountable to the Loksabha. If the Loksabha rejects
the Policy of the government on a particular issue, it is not only the responsible Minister for that subject,
but the whole Council of Ministers must accept the responsibility and resign.

The State Executive
The Governor

The Governor is appointed by the President of India on the advice of the Council of Ministers headed
by the Prime Minister. The President can appoint a person as the Governor of more than one state. Any
citizen of India who is 35 years of age or above may be appointed as the Governor. The term of the Governor
is for five years. However, he holds office during the "Pleasure" of the President and can be removed from
office even before the expiry of his term or he can also be transferred to any other State as the Governor.

The Governor is the Constitutional and formal head of the State. All executive powers of the State
government are vested in him. He appoints the chief Minister who has a clear Majority. He also appoints
other members of the Council of Ministers on the advice of the Chief Minister. He appoints the Advocate
General, the Chairman, the members of the State Public Service Commission. He is consulted by the President
of India for the appointment of judges of the High Court.

The Governor has significant legislative powers. He summons and prorogues the sessions of the State
Legislature. He can dissolve the state Assembly before the expiry of it's full term. He can also issue ordinances.
A Bill passed by the state Legislature can become a law only after the Governor assents to it.

The position of the Governor in a State is similar to that of the President at the Centre. His powers
are actually exercised by the Council of Ministers headed by the Chief Minister. But the Governor can
exercise certain powers independently also. Normally, the Governor of a state is Ex-officio Chancellor of
all the universities of the State. A Governor can belong to any political party. But after assuming his post

the Governor has to perform his duties firmly and impartially.

(79) Organs of Government


--- PAGE 78 ---
The Chief Minister and Council of Ministers :

The Chief Minister is appointed by the Governor. The Governor appoints the leader of the majority
party as the Chief Minister. If no single party gets the majority, the leader of the combination of parties
constituting the majority or the leader of the largest party having the support of the majority is appointed
as the Chief Minister. Other members of the Council of Ministers are also appointed by the Governor on
the advice of the Chief Minister though the administration of the State is carried out in the name of the
Governor, in reality, the Chief Minister and the Council of Ministers enjoy most of the powers of the Governor.
In Gujarat the office of the Chief Minister and the Cabinet Ministers is situated in the New Secretariat -
Swarnim Sankul, Gandhinagar. The Governor administers the oath of secrecy to the Chief Minister and the
Council of Ministers orally and there after they sign the same. In the State Cabinet. Ministry there are four
types of Ministers : (A) Cabinet (B) State Level (C) Deputy Level (D) Parliamentary Secretary. The Chief
Minister distributes the portfolios to the Cabinet Ministers, He also presents the issues of policy making,
transparent administration, questions of people of the Central Government. During the time of calamity he
provides basic amenities, love and care to the people. He provides a strong leadership to the State Legislature.
The Chief Minister is the torch bearer and path finder of the government policies regarding the growth of
the State.

Administrative System (Administrative Executive) : The Political Executive frames various
policies in different fields. The detailed and efficient implementation of these policies is done by the
Administrative Executive. The Administrative Executive advises and guides the state executives in the matters
of policies. It provides required information and figures. However, the Political Executive is not bound to
follow the advice of it.

No matter how important or welfare oriented are the policies, laws if they are not effectively implemented
by the Administrative Executive then its purpose is marred. Thus the Administrative system provides the
necessary back up to the Executive in the formulation and implementation of policies. Expert and
professionally efficient and experienced public servants in the field of foreign relations, defence, security
forces, international trade and commerce, nuclear energy, energy, production, distribution, banking, insurance,
foreign exchange are the backbone of the Government. Collector is appointed as an Administrative Head
at District Level and his office is at "Jilla Seva Sadan". Their expertised knowledge, administrative insight,
broad experience, prediction, administrative efficiency helps them to carry out the administration effectively.
From the organs of the Government the State Executive acts as the brain behind the welfare of the people.
Whereas the Administrative Executive is like the limbs. An amicable relation between the Political Executive
and the Administrative Executive is the prerequiste for the smooth governance of the State.

The power and influence of the government is becoming more centered in the bureaucracy. Nepotism,
corruption, dishonesty, inefficiency, misconduct, escapism are the evils of bureaucracy. So to control such
evils Lokpal or Lokayukt is needed. To stop the corruption Gujarat State Government has Started an entire
seperate department by the name of Anti Corruption Bureau. Its toll free number is 1800 2334 4444. People
can contact the number to file their complaints.

Political stability is expected from the Administrative System as there is a Goverment comprising of
different political parties. The Administrative System helps to excel the development of the Government by
implementing various developmental schemes and programmes.

Governance at the Local Level

It is extremely difficult to carry out the Governance of the entire nation from a single place as the
Central Government has way too many responsibilities. The power is decentralised with the objective to timely
solve various problems, needs, expectations and aspirations of the people. By decentralizing the power, the
administration can be carried out easily and efficiently. At the local level the Institute of Local Self Governance
have emerged. When the administration of a village, town or city is carried out by the representative of
the people elected by the locals in the local institutions then such organisations are called Institutes of Local
Self Governance. For administrative efficiency of geographical regions the responsibility and functions of
the Government are divided to the local organisations. Similarly the municipality, municipal corporation are
the Institutes of Local Self Governance of urban area an for villages one can find Gram Panchayat, Taluka
Panchayat and District Panchayat.

ocial Science, Std. 9


--- PAGE 79 ---
Institutions of Local Self Governance give the training which is available for election, voting, duties,
responsibilities, administration and ruling; and opposing parties. It gives an opportunity of self development.
As all the policies are implemented at the local level first, it gives a chance to improve the lacunas at the
upper levels too. Therefore Local Self Rule Organisations are known as the training schools and laboratory
of constitutional improvement in a democracy.

In 1992 in the entire country similar ‘Panchayati Raj’ and 'Urban Institutions of Local Self Governance'
came into existence.

Three Tier Structure of the Panchyati Raj :

(A) Institutions of Local Self Governance at the Rural Level : Gram Panchayat, Taluka Panchayat
and District Panchayat is an administrative structure. Each organisation is mutually joined from top to bottom.
At all the levels of the Panchayati Raj in order that the local developmental tasks, schemes and welfare
oriented programmes are carried out efficiently these organisations are provided with required funds and
means. There is a Chief of the District Panchayat and Variors Chairman of Various committees of the District
Panchayat whereas the administrative head is the District Development Officer (DDO) and the main office
of the District Panchayat is situated at the District head quarter.

Similarly the leader of the elected wing of the Taluka Panchayat is called the President and the head
of the administrative wing is called Taluka Development Officer (TDO). At the lower level Sarpanch is the
representative elected by the people, and the administrative head is the Talati-cum-Minister and he handles
the administration of the Panchayat. The village in which the election and the Sarpanch are unanimously
elected are declared as 'Samras Village’ and it is honoured by a prize.

were provided with the Urban Institute of Self Governance as per the population of the area. At the first
level there is Municipality, at the second level there is Municipal Corporation and the third level there is
Maha Nagar Megacity Nigam. In all the three wings of the Urban Institute of Self Governance, a Mayor
is elected from the majority wing, Apart from this there are Chairman of various Committees and Corporators
as per various wards. Ward wise reservation for women and reserved castes is maintained. Various
Committees carry out various responsibilities of many fields in a decentralised manner. City Planning, land
reforms, roads, bridges, flyovers, bridge construction, water management, sewage management, civil
development environmental facility, fire department service, education-health, culture and entertainment, city
scape development, development of morgue, crematorium, graveyard, removal of slum, over all development
etc are carried out by the Urban Institute of Self Governance. All are managed by funds collected from
people under the Public Private Partnership (PPP) as well as the taxes collected from the people and
Government Grants. The administrative head of the municipal corporation is known as the ‘Municipal
Commissionaire’. Under him there are zonal heads having technical and administrative knowledge and various
officers. When a cordial relation is established between the elected wing and the administrative wing then

many works can be carried out relating to the welfare of the people.
Judiciary :

The Constitution of India has accepted the ideals that all its citizen should get social, economic and
political justice Thereby a just and equitable social order can be established. If any person breaks any law
then he is either punished or fined by the judiciary. The judiciary checks whether the laws are in accordance
with the constitutional provision. And if the law is not consistent with the Constitution it declares the law

unconstitutional and void.

If Federal System powers and functions are divided among Unit States and Centres, it is the function
of the Judicial System to see that both the Central and the State government carry out their own work without
interfering with each other's work. When any disputes arise between the Centre and the Unit State then
they are solved by the Supreme Court.The Indian judiciary is continuous and linear. At the top at the Central
Level there is the Supreme Court, at the middle at the State Level there are High Courts and at the bottom

level there are Trial Courts, Civil Courts, Criminal Courts and various subordinate Courts.

Organs of Government


--- PAGE 84 ---
Indian Judiciary

We have studied in detail about the two organs of the Government, the Legislative and the Executive.
Now we shall study in detail about the third organ of the Government, the Judiciary, which is the independent,

statutory and impartial organ of the government.

The Consitution of India provides for a systematic, organized and uniform judicial system throughout
India. The Indian judiciary system is in the form of a pyramid hierarchy. We have established a uniform
judiciary and in it at the top most level there
is a Supreme Court which is the Apex court
at the middle level there are High Courts
> ChiefCourt and Tribunals (High Court) and under their jurisdiction are the District
Courts at the district level and at the taluka
level there are Local and Special courts.
Apart from these there are Trial Courts and
Tribunals, which are established to cater to

> (Supreme Court)

> District Court + Taluka Court

> Trial Court and Special Courts

various objectives.
Importance of Judiciary

A neutral and impartial Judiciary is essential in the Federal System for the protection and preservation of
the rights of the Indian citizens and to solve any incongruity between the Center and State or between One State
and the other State regarding the division of workload. The Judiciary is an important organ as to interpret
Constitutionality of any provision of any Law so that the supermacy of the Constitution prevails. In order that the
Legislature or the Executive do not violate any of the Constitutional limitations, we require in a country, Indepen-
dent, firm, impartial and fearless Judiciary which is the foundation of democracy. The objective of the Constitu-
tion is to see that in the Judiciary process there is no flaw or delay and the citizens get quick, cheap and equal
justice.

In the presence of alert Legislature and Executive, the Judiciary would always remain active; but many a
times due to administrative inactiveness and irresponsibility of the Executive and an authoritativeness of the
Legislature impartial, congnizant, independent and fearless Judiciary has shown Judical inactivness.

Apex Court (Supreme Court)

Supreme Court is at the apex of the Indian Judiciary. As per the Constitution of India it is the top most
judicial organization. It is situated in Delhi. All the civil and criminal courts of India have to work under the
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court consists of one chief justice and 28 additional judges. The
chief justice of the Supreme Court is appointed by the President of India. The number of judges in the Supreme
Court is decided by the Parliament but if the President feels that the workload of the Supreme Court is increased
then the President can appoint additional adhoc judges to the Supreme Court as per the provision of the Consti-
tution. The judges in the Supreme Court are appointed on the basis of seniority. Except for the chief justice of the
Supreme Court all the other judges are appointed in consultation with the chief justice as well as other senior
judges.

Qualifications :A person who is appointed as judge of the Supreme Court should be -

(1) A citizen of India.

(2) Should have provided a service of at least 5 years as a judge in any one of the High Court of
India or

(3) Should have an experience of at least 10 years as an advocate in any of the High Court of
India or

(4) Should be a distinguished judge or a famous jurist as per the opinion of the President or
(5) Should not be more than 65 years of age.

ocial Science,


--- PAGE 85 ---
Thus the retirement age is 65 years for the judges of the Supreme Court.

Time Period : The retirement age is 65 years for a judge of the Supreme Court. However the change
in the age of retirement can be made by the Parliament through framing a law. They cannot carry the
practice of law in any of the Indian courts but they can provide their services in committees appointed to
investigate into uncommon situations or events. If incapable to carry out their duties before the time of
retierment then under such circumstances they can resign willingly from their posts by tendering written
resignation to the President. But the judges can be removed from their posts and power if they are found
to be guilty of incapability, misconduct or inefficiency. This removal is in accordance with the provisions of
the constitution and is carried out through “Impeachment Motion in Parliament.” The procedure for it is as
follows. Every House of Parliament has to submit a memorandum having majority support to the President
of the total number of members and at least 2/3 (two third)number of the members present in the respective
sesion. Based on the presentation, by the order of the President, the judge can be removed from his post.
The Parliament monitors the presentation of the memorandum regarding the misbehaviour of the judge and
the conducting of the investigation as well as the conducting of proof for the same.The concerned judge
is given the opportunity to present his naration in his self-defence in the Parliament.

The President of India administers the oath of secrecy and loyalty towards the Constitution , to the
judges who appointed to the Supreme Court. Before taking the charge of their posts the judges are required
to take the oath in oral as well as sign the pledge.

The Power and Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court

The Supreme Court of India posseses more powers and has vast jurisdiction in
comparison to any other country of the World. This jurisdiction can be divided into Original Jurisdiction, Appel-
late Jurisdiction and Advisory Jurisdiction.

(1) Original Jurisdiction : When a court has a power to directly give judgment after hearing a case,
such a power is known as Original Jurisdiction and the Supreme court has the power to make decision
regarding the case, which no other courts has. Under this jurisdiction the following parties should be invoived
whose conflicts are resolved by the Supreme Court.

(i) It has the power to settle the dispute between the Government of India and one or more states.

(ii) It has the power of resolving difference of opinions, fights or conflicts between the Government
of India and one or more states on the other side and one or more other States.

(iii) It has complete power to give judgment regarding fights or quarrells between State-States.

(iv) The Supreme Court has the right to give judgement concerning any set of Union Government
or constitutionality.

(v) It has the power to protect and preserve the Fundamental Rights of the citizen of India. Moreover
it is empowered to issue of Habeas Corpus Mandamus or order of prohibition.

It is not in the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to settle disputes related to the distribution of river waters
between state-state, states-state, state-states or states-states. A separate “Water Tribunal’ gives Judgement.
The judgment of the Supreme Court is final and it cannot be challenged anywhere. They have to be respected
by all.

(2) Appellate Jurisdiction: three types of appeals can be made in the Supreme Court under
the Appellate Jurisdiction. (i) Cases of Constitutional interpretation (ii) Appeal against the civil cases
(iii) Appeal against criminal cases.

(i) Any person can approach a Supreme Court against the judgment, order or writ given by the High
Court on any case only if a certificate is issued by the High Court along with the judgment that the case
involves any matter pertaining to the constitution which has been falsely interpreted or contains any important
question of law and hence the petitioner can appeal in the Supreme Court for the same. If any such

C1) Indian Judiciary


--- PAGE 86 ---
certification is not given by the High Court and if the petitioner approaches the Supreme Court then in such
circumstances if the Supreme Court finds that any constitutional right is violated then it can accept the
petitioner’s appeal. But in any of the circumstances only the petitioner who is a party in the working of
High Court, can approach the Supreme Court, only under the reasons that a false judgment is issued by

the High Court or any other Court.

(ii) In case of the civil cases if the High Court certifies that the case involves important question of
interpretetion of law and that the case holds general importance and it is necessary that Suprme Court decides,
then an appeal can be made in the Supreme Court. Judgment of any civil cases involving a sum of rupees

one lakh or more can be challenged in the Supreme Court.

(ili) In case of the criminal cases if any lower court has acquitted the criminal from a capital punishment
and in that case the High Court has given capital punishment to the criminal then in such circumstances
an appeal can be made in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court can review its own judgments. It can
transfer cases, that are going on in other courts to the Supreme Court. The Parliament can increase the

powers of the Supreme Court by framing Act.

(3) Advisory Jurisdiction : If the President feels that any particular matter or question holds
importance from the point of view of public welfare then the President can take a counsel of the Supreme
Court by sending the matter or question to the Supreme Court for consideration. Under this provision the
President can avail counsel from the Supreme Court in the questions pertaining to law, reality, and
constitutional interpretation or relevancy of any Bill. But if the Supreme Court finds it unnecessary to consider
or give opinion on the sent matter it can send it back to the President. And it is not mandatory for the

President to follow the advice or counsel given by the Supreme Court.

(4) Other powers : A Supreme Court has the power to review its own judgment or decision. The
Supreme Court can punish for 'Contempt of the Court’. Supreme Court has a power to nullify any steps,
law taken by the Executive if it violates the Constitution. This right has been given to the President in the
constitution under the provision of Right to Constitutional Remedies. Supreme Court is thus the guardian and

savior of the constitution and citizens.
Court of Records

Court of Records holds an evidential value and when any records from the court are presented, no objec-
tion can be taken against it. The judgments and decisions of the Supreme Court are considered as permanent
documents and all are bound to accept it. They are used as references by the subordinate courts while giving

judgments and decisions. Any court showing its contempt or disapproval can be punished.
High Court

One of the key positions in the continuous hierarchical pyramid of the Indian Judiciary is occupied at the
state level by the High Courts. High Court is the apex court at state level. The constitution provides one high
court for every state. The President has the power to form one High Court for two or more states. In India there
is one common High Court for the states of Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh. Similarly under the jurisdiction of

the High Court of Assam falls the states of Manipur, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Tripura, Mizoram and Arunachal

Pradesh.

--- PAGE 87 ---
Formation : The chief justice of the High Court is appointed by the President in consultation with the chief
justice of the Supreme Court and the governor of the respective state. The chief justice of High Court is
consulted in the appointment of the other judges of the High Court. A President is a representative of the Prime
Minister and the Cabinet of Ministers and hence only President appoints a chief justice only after discussion and
consultation with the Prime Minister and the Cabinet Ministers.

The age limit of judges of the High Court is 62 years. They can tender resignation addressed to the
President. The President can remove any of the judges of the High Court through the process of impeachment
carried out in the Parliament and on proving the charges of misconduct or malpractice of the judges. The judges
of the High Court can be transferred anywhere in India. The number of judges is not the same in all the High
Courts of India. If the President feels that the workload of the High Court has increased then he can appoint
adhoc in-charge judges to the High Court for a period of two years. All the work of the Supreme Court and the
High Court is carried out in English language but if any Legislative Assembly of any state passes a resolution that
the work of the High Court of related state be carried out in the language of that state then the work of the High
Court of that state can function in the language of that state.

Qualification : As per the provision of the Constitution the person eligible to be appointed to the High
Court (i) Should be a citizen of India (11) Should have served for a minimum period of 10 years on any of the
judicial post in the lower court of the Indian states. (111) Should have at least 10 years of practice as an advocate
in the High Court (IV) Should be a distinguished jurist, constitutional expert or famous law maker as per the
opinion of the President. (v) Should be below 62 years of age.

The Judge of the High Court has to take an oath of secrecy in front of the governor of the state or any
person appointed by the governor and sign the corresponding Pledge.

The Jurisdiction of the High Court : The power and functions of the High Court can be divided into the
following three jurisdictions :

(1) Original Jurisdiction : Under the original jurisdiction the High Court is empowered to issue
directions, orders or writs including writs in the nature of Habeas Corpus to any person, authority and any
government in case of violation of the fundamental rights of citizens. The High Court has the authority in
the cases related to companies, marriage, divorce and alimony. The cases of contempt of court, land revenue
and its imbursement, land reforms and returns can also be carried out in the High Court. All writ petitions
challenging the judgments given by Lower Court of the civil and the criminal courts can be made in the
High Court. These petition challenging the provisions provided in the entrance examination.

(2) Appellate Jurisdiction : Under the appellate jurisdiction of the High Court the court hears the
petition against the civil and the criminal cases. Any petition challenging the judgment of the lower courts
and tribunals can be made in the High Court. In case a Session Court has issued any judgment punishing
the accused for more than 4 years, then the petitioner can challenge the judgment in the High Court. If
any accused is given a capital punishment by a Sessions Court in a case of murder for which a less severe
punishment is issued by the lower court then in such condition the judgment can be challenged in the High
Court. The petitioner who is unsatisfied with the judgment of the Tribunal can also approach a High Court.
The High Court has a power to decide upon important questions pertaining to law including constitutional
interpretation.

(3) Administrative Jurisdiction : Each High Court has the authority and power to supervise the
working of all subordinate courts and Tribunals of the state or of its region. If the High Court feels it is
necessary then it can ask case papers from the subordinate court and then carry out the case proceedings.
The Court can frame general Laws to control the procedure and Functioning of the Courts under its power.
The High Court can decide criteria and tabular form of various types of fees. All these provisons should
be in accord and harmony with the Constitution. The High Court can guide and direct the subordinate Courts
in the matter of maintaining records snd entries.

C9) Indian Judiciary


--- PAGE 88 ---
The High Court occupies the place as the Court of Records. The High Court publishes its judgments,
decisions in an organised form.. These Judgements and decision are binding and final for they can use these
court decisions and judgments as reference while taking decisions on various cases in future. The lawyers
use these published judgments and decisions as citations while pleading their cases. The court has a power
to punish for contempt of Court.

The High Court of Gujarat is located on the Sarkhej-Gandhinagar Highway, Sola, Ahmedabad.
Subordinate Courts

Under the guidance and supervision of the High Court of any state there are District and Taluka Courts,
Fast Track Court, POTA Courts, Tribunals and certain special courts. Each state is divided into an administrative
unit called District, consisting of a Civil Court, Criminal Court and Revenue Court.

District Judge

The appointment and promotion of any individual to the post of a District Judge is done by the Governor of
the respective state in consultation with the High Court of that state.

Qualifications : A person being appointed as a District Judge should be a citizen of India, should possess
a practice as an advocate for at least seven years. An officer in the judiciary of either the state or the Central
Government too is eligible to be appointed as the Judge of the District Court. All the other judges other than the
District Judge are appointed by the Governor or the High Court in consultation with the State Public Service
Commission in accordance with the rules framed by the Constitution.

The judge who handles the civil suites is called as the District Judge and the Judge who handles the criminal
cases is called a Sessions Judge. A District Court hears the petitions challenging the judgments of the lower
courts under it. All the civil suits of rupee one lakh or more either by the Government or against the government
are carried out in the district civil courts. The Judge of the District Court has the power to run the cases of
marriage, divorce, alimony, reforms and cases of parental custody.

The criminal courts include Session Court, First Class Judicial Magistrate Court, Second Class Judicial
Magistrate Court, Mamlatdar and Executive Magistrate Court. These courts have a power to give punishment
of imprisonment ranging from 3 to 10 years and a penalty up to rupees 5000 or more. In case of a murder, the
court can give capital punishment, life time imprisonment and life sentence.

Apart from these in a district there are small cause court and family court too. For the case pertaining to
land-revenue there is Revenue Court and for the disputes of the labourers there is a Labour Court along with
other Tribunals. As per example a Tribunal for compensating vehicle-accidents, for the protection of service and
other rights of the teachers and professors there is a ‘Gujarat Educational Organisation Service Tribunal’,
Tribunals for recovering debts, for the protection of consumer’s right, ‘Consumer’s Rights Protection Forum’.
These tribunals function like a court and help the cases wherein the petitioners recover their losses and receive
compensation. In each district there is a ‘Fast Track Court’ with an objective to run a case faster. For hearing
the cases of POTA, there are POTA Courts in Gujarat. All these courts have gathered importance by decentral-
izing their administration and function independently, firmly and lawfully. People have started taking all the
benefits and have become aware.

Lok Adalats

Gujarat state is first to start Lok Adalats to provide speedy and economical justice to the poor, weak and
exploited section of the society. Under this the court provides free support and guidance through ‘Legal Aid
Service Center’ situated in Ahmedabad. Lok Adalats function voluntarity even on Sundays and holidays at the
district and taluka headquarters as per the convenience of the petitioners. The Lok Adalats generally hear the
cases of accident and is related compensation, divorce, alimony, general debts, personal complaints, police

ocial Science,


--- PAGE 89 ---
complaints etc. Lok Adalats consist of advocates, social workers, educationists, reputed citizens, businessmen,
police officers, insurance officers, judges and judicial officers. Here cases are settled amicably such that both
the parties are satisfied. The cases fought in the Lok Adalats are neither won nor loss. Lok Adalats save time
and money. Many pending cases are solved. All the judgments of the Lok Adalats are backed by the law.
Therefore the Lok Adalats have become a centre of attraction.
Independence of Judiciary

The Indian Constitution has kept the Judiciary independent, firm and fearless from the Legislature and the
Executive for the protection of the fundamental rights of the citizens, for the social, political and economical
equality and for providing justice. The Judiciary should not be inclined or biased towards the Government. The
terms and conditions for the appointment of judges, the appointment process, pay scales, transfer, promotion,
retirement etc. is taken care of by the Executive as per the constitutional provision. The judges are appointed for
a specific period of time. The Executives cannot remove any of the judges due to their will or any political
pressure. The pay scale, the term of service, promotion, transfer, benefits of promotion, pension fund of the
judges cannot be altered. During the term of service of the judges any of their behaviour or their judgments
cannot be discussed or critically reviewed in the Parliament or the Legislative Assembly. The judges after their
retirement cannot carry out their practice in any of the courts. The purpose is to empower the judges to perform
their duties fearlessly, honestly, self reliantly, independently and firmly so that the judges can impart true, trans-
parent and quick justice. The Indian Constitution has given the Judiciary an independent, impartial and uniform
place. The cases of public welfare, the questions of public welfare or important problems pertaining to public
welfare can be written on a simple post card or an ordinary letter to the Supreme Court. In the past, the Supreme
Court has treated such matters as petitions and has given trend setting judgments. This has proved the vigilance
of the Judiciary in the public.

At present there are about 3.5 crore pending cases in our Judiciary. Insufficient number of courts, judges
and staff is the reason in the delay in justice. The present Central Government has undertaken the task of

reframing one and a half thousand old and irrelevant laws.

Indian Democracy

India has the highest number of voters in the world. Population wise India is the largest democratic
country of the world. This amazing democracy is more than six decades old. During this period in India
there has been many political upheavals and up and downs. The Indian democracy is sustained due to the

dedication and insight of its citizens. We shall study in detail the characteristic features of Indian democracy.
Election in Democracy

In the world many countries have democracy. In spite of democracy there exists differences in
Governance of these countries. In a democracy a voter casts his own vote. The right to vote remains the
same in each democratic country though the country’s Governance may vary. The democracy thrives through
the voting process of the voters during the elections. Our country has a Parliamentary System. Parliament
is the national institution representing the people. The Parliament of India consists of the President, the Vice
President, Rajyasabha, and Loksabha. As mentioned in earlier chapter, Rajyasabha is the Upper House of
the Parliament and the Loksabha is the Lower House of the Parliament. The State has the Legislative
Assembly. Some states have the Legislative Council also. A voter is at the centre in forming a Rajyasabha,
Loksabha, and Legislative Assembly or Legislative Council. In our country all the governing bodies are elected

through voting. Thus democracy is realized by elections.
Democracy and Voter

A voter is very important in a democracy. Our country has Universal Adult Suffrage. A person of 18
year of age or above who is enlisted in the voter list can cast vote. A person who has not declared bankruptcy
or is not mentally unstable can vote without any discrimination. The Constitution guarantees a right to vote
even amidst illiteracy, poverty and many similar issues. The system of Universal Adult Suffrage is based
on the principle of ‘One Person One Vote.’ It is the duty of every citizen to vote without greed or fear.
A voter should be aware and vigilant of his right. The Constitution has provided a right to vote to each of
its citizens without the discrimination of caste, creed, religion or education. Voting is an important process
in democracy. In our country there is a Universal Adult Suffarge. Voting is a right as well as a duty of citizens.

Every voter should exercise the right to vote.
Election — The Foundation of Democracy

Election is the foundation of democracy. A festive environment is seen during elections. The people can
evaluate their representatives during elections. Any person who has the pre-requisite to contest elections can do
so. Candidates belonging to the political parties as well as the independent candidates who do not belong to any
political party can contest election. In an election the winning candidate of any party or belonging to a coalition
of parties come to power. In a democracy only with the support of the people one can reach to power. In our
democracy Parliament is the apex body and the basic foundational block is the Gram Panchayat. Elections are
also held in the Institutions of Self Government like the Gram Panchayat, Taluka Panchayat and District Panchayat.
Candidates in these Institutions of Local Self Government are chosen through elections. Elections are conducted

in Municipality in towns and Municipal Corporation in cities. Election is the life line of a nation’s democracy.

(93) Indian Democracy


--- PAGE 92 ---
Elections are very important for the political parties as well as the candidates. Election is the barometer
of Democracy. Election provides an opportunity to a voter to evaluate the contesting candidates. Election
ushers in new political set up or political waves. Election gives a picture of a country’s social and economic
environment. Election decides the future of the Government. Elections are contested by political parties,
independent candidates, as well as a coalition of political parties. In Parliamentary Democracy , the party
or a coalition of parties having majority of winning candidates forms the Government and comes in power.The
power is obtained as well as maintained by the support of the people.Election being soul of a demorcacy
it is essential that it is transparent.

Public Opinion in Democracy

We have a democratic country. The candidate who wins the election represents the people.
In representative system the ruling party would like to regain and retain its power. To regain and retain its
power it becomes essential for the political parties to connect with the people. To maintain and run the
government, it becomes essential to consider public opinions and thoughts for framing policies or for various
questions pertaining to many problems. Public opinion is highly essential for political parties, representatives
and organizations. Collective public opinion is extremely important in democracy.

Strong and organized public opinion is very important in Democracy. Malfunctioning of the Government
can be presented through public opinion. Public opinion helps in creating such a condition where the
Government cannot afford to misrule or neglect the country. Alert and intelligent public that keeps itself
informed cannot be misled by the Government. Various mediums in the modern times have proved to be
very important in creating public opinion. Let us obtain detailed information of these mediums.

Media of Public Opinion in Democracy

To cultivate the human psyche and to create a strong public opinion the various information and
broadcasting agencies are very useful. In today’s time various mediums are used to transmit information
to the public. These mediums contributing to build strong and effective public opinion are :

Print Media : In today’s world newspapers, periodicals and journals hold utmost importance in
facilitating people to know more about incidences, events and situations taking place nationally as well as
internationally. Print media helps people to evaluate their opinions either in favour or against the information
presented by them. The same information presented by the print media can create multiple view points in
the people. People give different individual responses to the same information and develop individually diverse
opinion.

It is essential that the opinions created are true, firm and unbiased. If the print media presents biased
or false details then it is possible to create a false public opinion. It is absolutely essential to have ‘ Freedom
of Press’ so that a false public opinion is not created by presenting only achievements of the Government
and thereby hiding the faults, failures or shortcomings of the Government. Ours is a diverse nation in terms
of language, culture and regional varieties. The regional newspapers are much sought after in corresponding
regions. Regional newspapers then have an immense contribution in cultivating public opinion. Print media
has failed in cultivating public opinion in countries and regions having less literacy rates. In spite of this various
organizations, industrial groups and political parties publish their own dailies or periodicals owing to the
influence exerted by printed material. The Government also publishes various periodicals and issues providing
important information.

Electronic Media : Audio visual media like the radio, television, cinema etc. are important in cultivating
public opinion. Electronic media is more effective in the regions of lower literacy rates. It is seen that radio
and television are considered far more important than newspapers and periodicals. Live telecast of incidents
occurring nationally as well as internationally can be easily made available through the mediums of radio and

Social Science, 9 (94)


--- PAGE 93 ---
television. A public opinion can be created through the serials, dramas and movies which can help portray
socioeconomic as well as other problems like untouchability, dowry, exploitation and poverty in an entertaining
manner.

In today’s world apart from television the arrival and spread of internet has helped people to enjoy news,
serials, dramas and movies sitting comfortably in their homes. All these media can create an adverse effect
through the presentation of distorted, obscene and violent information. Hence it is essential to monitor and
control transmission of harmful content through these important mediums. In a democracy it is desirable that the
political parties and NGOs protest against various obscene and violent programmes telecasted by the electronic
media.

Today in the fast moving age of technology people can stay in constant touch with each other through the
medium of internet or smart cell and exchange thoughts as well as ideas. Electronic media is widely used to
cultivate public opinion. Television, radio, personalized radio i.e. FM plays a special role in cultivating public
opinion in modern times.

In today’s time, rumours spread instantaneously in the absence of facts and details. Hence there remains a
danger of false public opinions being generated. Various types of surveys carried out by electronic media help
create public opinion. Surveys are carried out to know public opinion with the help of some details. ‘Opinion
Polls’ are presented during the elections. Opinion polls help to estimate the direction of public opinion. Opinion
polls are not always true and reliable.

Electronic media are very important in today’s time. In a democracy the people and the Government should
exercise patience. Electronic media helps to transmit people’s thoughts, details and talks to the government and
similarly helps transmit details about the various plans and achievements of the government to the people. Radio
can reach in distant and remote areas. But as it is only audio media it has been less effective. Television
programmes though expensive in nature have gained more public viewership than radio. In a democracy it is
desirable that public opinion should be cultivated so as to cater to the needs of the welfare of the nation.

Types of Democracy : Various countries in the world have democracy. There still exists diversity within
various democracies of different countries. Our country has a Parliamentary democratic system. In a country
like USA there is a presidential parliamentary system. We shall see in detail about the two types of democracies
i.e. Parliamentary Democracy and Presidential Democracy.

Parliamentary Democracy

Our country has accepted the Parliamentary Democracy. In a Parliamentary Democracy the President
appoints the leader of the party who gets the majority number of seats in the Loksabha as the Prime Minister.
The Prime Minister forms the Government. The Parliamentary Government is completely accountable to
the Loksabha. Government remains in power as long as it enjoys the confidence of the majority of the
members of the parliament.

Presidential Democracy : Presidential Democracy is the second important type of democracy. In such a
type of democracy the President is directly elected by the people. The President remains in power for a specific
period as mentioned in the Constitution. Presidential Democracy is prevalent in many countries including USA.
Election System in Democracy

Our country has maximum number of voters in the world. The Election Commission maintains the
administration, control and monitoring of the entire process of election. It is essential for any democracy
that its Election Commission is independent, impartial and autonomous. It is mandatory to maintain the
autonomy of the Election Commission. In the Constitution there is a special provision for the terms and
conditions of appointing the election commissionor, their criteria for service, or their removal or suspension
from their service. The responsibility and authority to hold elections for the Parliament, State Assembly,
Legislative Council, President and the Vice President rest with the Election Commission. The election of
our country is carried out by secret ballot. Legislative assembly or the Parliament is dissolved after every
five years and then fresh elections are held. The election carried out to elect a new candidate to fill up

(95 ) Indian Democracy


--- PAGE 94 ---
vacaul place due to death or resignation of the candidate is known as by-election. The dates of election,
advertisement, filling and scrutinizing the nomination forms, the dates for withdrawing the nomination forms,
the declaration of the final list of the eligible candidates, the allotment of election symbols etc. falls under
the work area of the Election Commission. From the time of announcement of the election dates a protocol
is implemented by the Election Commission. The Government is bound to abide by the protocol and not carry
out any activity or campaign that can affect the public opinion.

The candidates and the political parties come up with their own election manifesto. The election
manifesto reflects the proposed plans and works of the party in terms of economic, defence, foreign policy
and various problems.

Secret Ballot in Democracy

In our country elections are conducted in a complete independent and secret manner. Indian
parliamentary elections are considered to be the largest election process in the world. Various political parties,
organizations and independent candidates contest the elections. Each of them presents their works, ideas,
and future plans to the voters. It is expected that the voters vote without any benefit, greed or fear. ‘Secret
Ballot’ is given utmost importance in a democracy. A voter has a right to maintain the secrecy of his vote.
No one can ask a voter regarding his vote. The amazing process of election maintains the secrecy of each
voter's vote. The election commission facilitates the voting of all persons involved with the election process
as well as the army personnel too. Two processes are used for voting. (1) Voting by a ballot paper (2) Voting
through an Electronic Voting Machine(EVM). Counting ballot papers is more time consuming. Now a days
most of the voting is carried out using EVMs. Counting votes in EVMs is less time consuming. It saves
time and labour. Voting by using EVM is environment friendly as it does not make use of the paper. If a
voter decides to exercise his right to vote but not to cast his vote in favour of any of the contesting candidates,
he can use the option of NOTA( None of the Above).

Democracy and Political Parties

India is multi party democracy and hence we have various political parties. Specific criteria are fixed
by the Election Commission to validate any political party. Political parties are classified either into National
party or Regional party based on certain specific policies and criteria decided by the Election Commission.
As per this a party that secures more than four percent of the total votes in the previous general elections,
in at least four major states, is identified as a national party and the rest are identified as regional parties.
As per the information given by the Election Commission by March 10", 2014 a total of 1593 national parties
were registered. Last year 239 parties were added.

In our country Indian National Congress (INC) and Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) are the two major political
parties. Along with this Bahujan Samajwadi Party (BSP), Communist Party of India Marxist (CPIM) and
National Congress Party (NCP) are the other national parties. Apart from this the Shivsena, Trinamool
Congress,Samajwadi Party (SP), Dravida Munnetra Kalagram (DMK), All India Anna Dravida Munnetra
Kalagam (AIADMK), Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Jantadal United (JDU), Rashtriya Janta Dal (RJD), are
regional parties. Based on the specified criteria any national party can lose its status or any regional party
can gain the status of the national party depending on the number of votes obtained by the party. The party
forming the Government is known as the ruling party. The party which forms the opposition is called the
opposition party.

The opposition party helps form public opinion by democratically opposing the objectionable plans and
policies of the Government. But in a healthy democracy it is desirable that the opposition party supports
the social and public causes of the ruling party which are aimed at the welfare of the nation. The success
of democracy depends on a balanced relationship between the ruling and opposing party. Effective and strong
opposition party is a pre-requisite of a good democracy. Democracy is like a chariot. Ruling party and the
opposing party are the two wheels of the chariot.

We are acquainted with the events and the circumstances which affected many countries of
the world in the beginning of the last century. The Independence Movement and the Independence
of our country are among the most important events of the last century incorporating the world
as a whole. We have carved out a new way by successfully completing the challenges created
before the newly independent nations. We are determined to reformation of a new nation with a
responsible administration, civil rights, independent judiciary etc.

Tt is almost the completion of second decade of the twenty first century. With India’s
progress march of six decades, it will be easier for us to view it for the planning of development.

Natural resources and their location are an important base for the endless possibilities of the
economic development and progress of any country. In this context, the study of
physiography, drainage system, bio-diversity of our country will be of much interest. A diversity in
the lifestyle, food habits, dresses, or rituals etc. create an exact picture ofa large nation. With the
knowledge of disaster management, we can reduce the intensity of the impact of the disaster.

India holds a unique position among the countries of the world. India is a country having
largest democracy and its culture is one of the oldest. It has the largest democracy in the
world. The coordinating attitude of our culture has not discarded any religion, race or people,
but has accepted them whole heartedly. Thus, impartiality towards all religions, people and races
is the peculiar characteristics of India. That is why India has become a “cultural confluence.”

Even though many natural and man-induced disasters have taken place, India has consistently
continued her progress. The geographical conditions have contributed immensely towards the
development and progress of Indian culture.

13.1 India in the World

India: Location, size and area:

Geographically, India lies in the northern hemisphere. It extends up to the southern part of Asian
continent. The span of the mainland of India extends from 8° 4’ to 37°6’ North latitudes and from 68°
7 to 97°25’ East longitudes. The Tropic of Cancer, which is located at 23°5’ north latitude and divides
the country into two parts, passes through the centre of India. Its northern part is spread more in the
east-west direction. The large plains and the Himalayan mountain system are located in this part. The
area to the south of Tropic of Cancer has a triangular shape and tapers towards the south. This is
basically apart of the peninsular plateau. It includes the eastern plains and the narrow western coastal
plains.

The latitudinal as well as longitudinal extents of India are almost equal, which is about 30°, but
actually the length between Kashmir to Kanniyakumari is 3214 km and from Gujarat to Arunachal
Pradesh, the width is 2933 kilometres. There is a difference of two hours in the local times between
the two extreme places starting from Gujarat in the west up to Arunachal Pradesh in the east due to
the longitudinal difference. When it is sunrise in Arunachal Pradesh, it is still night time in Gujarat.
The standard meridian of India is 82°30' east longitude. It passes through five states. Its local time is
accepted as the standard time of India.

The land area of India lies in south Asia. In the north, lofty mountain ranges are spread over
hundreds of kilometres from west to east direction. That is why, the commuting with Tibet and China
is possible only through passes located at high altitude. Bay of Bengal lies to the east, Arabian Sea to
the west and Indian Ocean to the south of peninsular India. The sea is utilised as a waterway. Even
though the land routes are obstructed by surrounding mountains, India has accepted all cultural elements
arriving from outside, and these have merged into Indian society.

13.3 Strategic location of India

India holds a strategic location in eastern hemisphere, and it has a strategic importance also. India
is in the eastern hemisphere. Oceans have contributed immensely in developing mutual relations in
ancient times. India had trade relations with East Africa, West Asia, South Asia and South-East Asia
since ancient times. India had developed cultural and commercial relations with them due to her location.
No country in Indian Ocean has along maritime boundary as India has. Due to this strategic location,
the ocean is named as Indian Ocean.

Location of India across the international waterways is also important. With the opening of Suez
Canal in 1869, the distance between India and Europe has reduced by about 7000 kilometres. Sea routes
connecting East and South-East Asia and Australia to Africa and Europe pass through the Indian Ocean.
The Circum African waterway and Suez Canal waterway pass by India. Canada and U.S.A. can be
reached through the same waterway via Strait of Malacca and the Pacific Ocean.

India has contacts with many countries since many centuries. Goods and ideas are being exchanged
since ancient times. Similarly, concepts of Upanishads, stories of Ramayana and Panchtantra, therapeutic
methods, Indian numerical figures and decimal system etc. could reach many parts of the world. India
has an important location in South Asia. There are 29 States and a National Capital Territory and 6 Union
Territories in India.

Geological structure :

The current physiography of Indiais the result of tectonic and crustal movements of the earth. Both
constructive as well as destructive effects of these movements are seen.

The knowledge about the interior of the earth is very interesting. The crust of the earth floats over
the semi-liquid rocks of the asthenosphere. Heat is
generated due to the radioactive process in the interior of
the earth. It tends to reach the surface of the earth by
generating convectional currents. These upward
currents break the upper layers which break into large
pieces which are known as “lithospheric plates” or “
tectonic plates”. There are seven major tectonic plates.
These are : (1) Pacific plate (2) North American plate
(3) South American plate (4) European plate (5) African
plate (6) Indo-Australian plate, and (7) Antarctic plate.
At some places, these plates are drifting away from
each other, which are known as divergent plates.

At some places these plates come closer to
each other, which are known as convergent plates.
Due to divergence and convergence processes, folding
and faulting take place. Due to the movements of 13.5 Tectonic Plates

these plates over millions of years, shapes of landforms as well as their locations have changed. The
process of divergence is responsible for all the tectonic and volcanic activities on the earth. Wherever
these drifting plates have collided with one another, it has resulted into mountain building process.
Wherever these plates drift away, fissures are created within landforms and oceans. The continents
situated along these fissures are drifting continuously. Such plates are called convergent plates.

--- PAGE 102 ---
India was a part of a very vast and an ancient landmass known as the Gondwanaland. This large
landmass consisted of the present South America, Africa, Australia and Antarctica. Over a period, the
“Indo-Australian plate “ started drifting gradually towards north. It is so believed that this plate collided
with the large European plate before about five crore years. Due to the collision between

Indo-Australian plate and the European plate, the Himalayan mountain system emerged out of Tethys Sea.

A large valley was formed to the south of the Himalayan system, wherein alluvial sediments were
deposited by the rivers flowing from north and south of it. Thus the Ganga plain between Himalayas and
the southern peninsula was formed. A huge volcanic eruption took place in the north-west of the
peninsular plateau as a result of which the western portion of the plateau was disintegrated and was
submerged. This led to the formation of Arabian Sea. Due to this submergence the Western Ghats

became more distinct.

Thus, a large diversity is seen in the Indian sub-continent. Lofty mountain ranges are seen in
the north. Many plateaus, summits and passes are seen within them. Ganga, Yamuna and Brahmaputra
rivers flow in the northern plains. Their alluvial deposits have formed this plain. Two edges in the form
of Ghats on two sides of the plateau and coastal plains on eastern and western margins are situated.

Thus, India holds a diversified physiography.

Social Science, 9 (106)


--- PAGE 105 ---
1. Northern mountainous region

This is an important natural region of India. It is known asthe Himalayan mountain system
spread over 2400 km in west-east direction in the north. It has an arc shape. Its width
ranges between 240 km to 320 kilometres. The Himalaya is not a single mountain, but is a
complex of many mountain ranges. Going towards east from Afghanistan, it extends upto Myanmar
via India, Nepal and Bhutan. It has more span in Tibet in the north. It is a part of the mountain
system known as the Pamir knot.

Himalayas on the whole can be divided into two divisions :

(1) Northern Himalayan Region (2) Eastern Himalayas

(1) Northern Himalayan Region : There are three mountain ranges parallel to each other.
The northern range is called the Greater Himalayas. This is the loftiest range among the Himalayas
wherein there are more than 40 peaks which exceed height of 7000 metres. Most famous
among them is Mt. Everest which is 8848 metres high. It is on Nepal — China border. It
is known as Sagarmaththa in Tibet. Other famous peak is Godwin Austin or K?( 8611 m )
which is the highest peak of India. There are three distinct ranges in Himalayas which are
almost parallel to each other. In the Greater Himalayas, there are some high mountain passes
such as Jelep La, Nathu La, Shipki La etc. Mansarovar, which is considered to be a sacred
holy place ( China ) is located in this range.

Like to know...

Mt. Everest 8848 metres
K2( Mt. Godwin Austin ) 8611 metres

Kanchenjungha 8598 metres
Makalu 8481 metres
Dhavalgiri 8198 metres
Annapurna 8070 metres

Second range, in the south of the Greater Himalayas is also spread ain wider area. It is called
Central Himalayas or the Lesser Himalayas. With a width ranging from 80 to 100 km, this range
includes mountain ranges like PirPanjal, Mahabharat, Nagtiba etc. Many hill stations have developed
in this moderately high range. Some of these hill stations are Dalhousie, Dharamshala, Shimla,
Mussoorie, Ranikhet, Almoda, Nainital, Darjeeling etc. Gangotri, Yamnotri, Badrinath, Kedarnath, Hemkund
Sahib etc. are famous holy places. Kullu, Kangada and Kashmir are extremely beautiful natural
valleys in this region.

Third range, situated in further south is known as Shivalik ( Outer Himalayas ) and most of it
falls within India. It is about 10 to 15 km wide and has an average height of 1000 metres. Peculiar
valley formations have taken place in this range which are covered by gravel, stones and thick
sediments. Locally these are known as ‘DUN’, e.g. Dehra Dun, Patlidun, Kotharidun etc.

(2) Eastern Himalaya : Ranges situated in the eastern part of Himalayan ranges have lesser
height. Some of them are more famous as Hills. These hills in eastern Himalayas are spread
as smaller ranges. Among them, Patkai Hills are situated in Arunachal Pradesh, Naga Hills in
Nagaland, and Lushai (Mizo) Hills in Mizoram. These hills are located near the eastern border
and have their continuation in ArakanYoma range of Myanmar. Garo, Khasi and Jaintia Hills
are in Meghalaya. Mountainous regions have more rainfall so dense forests have developed
here. As this is a forested area, roads and railways have not developed much.

2. Great Northern Plain :

This northern plain is located between the northern mountainous region and the southern
peninsula. This plain is formed due to the alluvial sediments brought by Himalayan rivers such as
Satluj, Ganga and Brahmaputra. At some places, the layers of the sediments are about 50 metres thick.
As these plains occupy very large area in North India, these are known as great plains of
Northern India.

G07) India : Location, Geological Structure And Physiography-IT



--- PAGE 106 ---
The plain is about 2400 km long. It is considered as one of the largest river plains
of the world. Its western part is narrower than the eastern part. The plain is almost a level
land. None of its part is higher than 180 metres from sea level. The plain is very narrow
near Delhi. The Satluj plain lies to the west of Delhi while the Ganga plain is in the east.
This plain is considered to be the most prosperous region of India. Important cities such as
Delhi, Kanpur, Lucknow, Allahabad, Varanasi, Patna, Kolkata etc. are situated in this plain.

Sindhu river and its tributaries Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas and Satluj originate in Himalayas. Generally, a
region between two rivers is called ‘DOAB’( ic. DO means two and AB means water ). Thus the plain
which is formed by five rivers is called ‘Punjab’ ( Panj + Ab). Most of this plain is in Pakistan.

On the basis of physiography, the plain is divided into four parts: (1) Bhabar (2) Tarai (3) Bangar
(4) Khadar. A small and narrow belt of gravels and stones lies parallel to the river from Sindhu up to
Tista river in Shivalik foothills. This belt is almost 8 to 16 km wide. It is called Bhabar. The Terai region
which is more humid and marshy comes next. Dense forests and diversified wild life are seen here. The
old alluvium in the plains is called “‘Bangar’. Due to consistent deposition, it develops a terrace shape
which is at a higher level than flood plains. The new sediment of the flood is called ‘Khadar’.

3. Peninsular Plateau

This is the oldest region of India. This region appears as an inverted triangle. Its average height
is about 600 to 900 metres. Its northern part slopes towards north-east which is evident from the flow
of Chambal, Son and Damodar rivers. The southern part slopes towards south-east. Most of its area is
in south, hence it is also called Southern Plateau. As it is surrounded by sea on its three sides, it is called
a Peninsular Plateau.

Peninsular Plateau can be divided into two parts (1) Malwa Plateau (2) Deccan Plateau.

(1) Malwa Plateau: Aravalli Range is situated to the north-west part of Malwa plateau.
Aravalli is one of the oldest ranges in the world. It is a folded mountain. Mt. Abu is the famous
hill station on this range. It is very beautiful and pleasant. Gurushikhar is its highest peak and
itis 1722 metres high. To the south of this region, the rivers Chambal and Betwa, emerging from
Vindhyachal, flow northwards and meet river Yamuna, while river Son flows northwards and meets
river Ganga. It can be known from the direction of river flow that the region slopes northwards.
The north-eastern part of this central upland is known as Bundelkhand. Besides this, rivers Luni
and Banas also originate in the Aravalli range in north-east. These rivers vanish in the Rann
of Kachchh while Sabarmati and Mahi rivers meet the Gulf of Khambhat. From the flow of
these rivers, it can be ascertained that the western part of Malwa Plateau slopes towards
south-west. Rajmahal Hills and Shillong plateau are a part of Chhota Nagpur plateau, which also
includes Ranchi plateau.

(2) Deccan Plateau : The Deccan Plateau is situated to the south of Satpuda, Mahadev
and Maikal ranges which are located to the south of the Malwa plateau. The north-western parts
of the plateau are composed of lava deposits. On the western side, its border is demarcated
by Western Ghats which runs north-south along the Arabian Sea coast. It has several local
names. It is known Sahyadri in Maharashtra and Karnataka, as Nilgiri in Tamil Nadu, as Annamalai
and Cardamum ranges along the border of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The southern portion of Western
Ghats is more lofty.

Generally the average height of Deccan Plateau ranges between 900 to 1000 metres, but at a few
places it exceeds that height. Few isolated hills having more than 900 metres of height form the eastern
boundary of this plateau. This is called ‘Eastern Ghats’. It has a general slope towards
south-east which is evident from the direction of the flow of the rivers. Except rivers Narmada and
Tapi which flow westwards, most of the rivers of Deccan Plateau flow eastwards and meet the Bay
of Bengal.

4. Coastal Plains (Plains along the sea coast ) :

Peninsular plateau is surrounded by a narrow a belt of plains from Kachchh to Odisha. It is divided
into western and eastern coastal plains. The west coast plain is spread from Gujarat to Kerala. Except
in Gujarat, the plain is mostly narrow. It is very much undulating and is knownas Malabar Coast to
the south of Goa. West coast rivers have developed creeks at their estuaries. Most of these creeks are
submerged valleys under river water. These are formed due to the emergence of sea shore. It provides
favourable conditions for fishery. There are many natural ports on the western coast, which include
Mumbai and Marmagao. Backwaters have developed along the southern coast of Kerala, and these are
known as Kayal in local language.

East coast plain is much broader than the west coast plain. There is substantial alluvial deposition
in the deltas of Kaveri, Krishna, Godavari and Mahanadi. Its northern coast is known as North Sircar
Coast and the Tamil Nadu coast is known as Coromandel coast.

(5) Archipelagos

There are few archipelagos in India. Andaman — Nicobar and Lakshadweep are major archipelagos
among them. There are many smaller islands in Lakshadweep and these are located at some distance
off Kerala coast. These islands have a horse-shoe shape. Such coral islands are called ‘Atolls’.

Andaman — Nicobar islands, are situated in the Bay of Bengal. Here, the number of islands is also
more and three are situated very far from Indian coast. There are few mountain ranges, some of which
are formed due to the volcanic activity. These islands are spread over 350 km and have a strategic
importance.

Like to know...

The only active volcano in India is ‘Barren‘ Island in Andaman — Nicobar archipelago. Narkondam,
which is very near to it is a dormant volcano.

Thus there is a diversity in the physical features of India. Every region has its own
distinct characteristics and yet all regions are inter connected. All of them have important contribution
in the progress of the nation and are useful in the forest resources. Northern fertile plains
are also called Storehouse of Grains. Southern plateau is rich in many mineral resources which
has enhanced the national progress. Many rivers with large volume of water originate in the
northern mountainous region which is also known for a variety of forest resources.

Rock

A composite matter made up of one or more minerals is called a ‘Rock’. Rocks can be hard as
well as soft. They can be porous or non-porous, and can be light or heavy in weight. Various types
of rocks are formed due to different processes. Rocks can be divided into three categories on the basis
of their formation. These are :

(1) Igneous rocks (2) Stratified rocks (3) Metamorphic rocks

--- PAGE 108 ---
(1) Igneous Rocks: The intense heat in the interior of the earth is responsible for the
formation of these rocks. The interior of the earth remains very hot due to this heat. So
the matter here is in semi liquid state, which is called as ‘Magma’. Eventually when this magma
cools down, rocks are formed. These rocks are formed due to the effect of heat, hence these
are called Igneous ( Agneya ) rocks. In the formation of the crust of the earth, these rocks
were formed earliest, so these are also called primary rocks.

At many places in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and southern peninsula in India, such rocks
are formed. Igneous rocks are most solid of all rocks. Granite is a well known example of
plutonic rock. Basalt is also this type of rock.

(2) Stratified Rocks : Igneous rocks disintegrate due to the collective effect of water and
other forces. These are also known as sedimentary rocks. The broken rock material is constantly deposited
in water and they form layers. Thus, rock material is deposited into different layers. The upper
layers exert pressure on the layers of underlying rocks, which were formed initially and are lying
at the bottom, and eventually rocks are formed with different layers. These are called ‘Stratified rocks’.
Its examples are gypsum, limestone and coal. Coal and gypsum are obtained from Bihar and Jharkhand
states.

(3) Metamorphic Rocks : In certain peculiar conditions, the form, composition and other
characteristics of rocks are totally changed. Due to the combined effect of two factors high temperature
and pressure of rock strata, the igneous and sedimentary rocks change into a totally new form. These newly
formed rocks are known as metamorphic rocks.

Marble and quartzite available in Rajasthan are their best examples.

Mineral

‘Mineral’ is that matter which is formed due to natural organic or inorganic process and has a
specific chemical composition. Minerals are available from the interior of the earth in solid, liquid and
gaseous forms. Minerals depend on the geological structure of the surface of the earth. Minerals such
as iron, copper, nickel, gold, silver etc. are found in igneous rocks. Coal, mineral oil and natural gas etc.
are available from stratified rocks, while slate, marble, diamond etc. are available from metamorphic rocks.

Classification of minerals: In our routine life, about 200 minerals are used directly or indirectly.
A universally accepted classification of minerals is not possible. However, a general classification can be
done as follows :

(1) Metallic minerals :

(a) Precious metallic minerals: gold, silver, platinum etc.

(b) Light metallic minerals : Magnesium, bauxite, titanium etc.

(c} Minerals of general use : Iron, copper, lead, zinc, tin, nickel etc.

(d) Minerals used alloys: chromium, manganese, tungsten, vanadium etc.
(2) Non — Metallic minerals : Limestone, chalk, asbestos, mica, fluorspar, gypsum, sulphur, diamond etc.
(3) Energy resources : Coal, mineral oil and natural gas, uranium, thorium etc.

Soil :

We know that soil is the basic resource for agriculture. Besides agriculture, soil is also very important.

Soil is a thin layer formed of the organic and inorganic matter on the surface of the earth. Soil is related
to the surface of the earth in the same way as the apple with its skin. The thin layer on the crust of the
earth is called soil.

Soil Formation: Soil is the result of denudation of rocks. The rock surface is eroded due to
factors like temperature, rain, snow, air, vegetation and insects and it turns into powdery form. Thus it
forms the land layer. In this layer, there are gravels, smaller stones, pebbles, soil particles etc.which are
known as ‘Ragolith’. It contains only mineral contents. Then the biotic matter, air and water are mixed
with it. Finally soil is formed out of this mixtore. The process of soil formation is a long term process.

Soils in India : Soils in India are classified into six types :

(1) Alluvial Soil (2) Black (or regur) soil (3) Red soil (4) Laterite soil (5) Mountain soil

(6) Desert soil.

--- PAGE 110 ---
(1) Alluvial Soil : Alluvial soil can be divided into two parts: (1) Khadar, and (2) Bangar.
The soil formed due to the fresh alluvial deposit is known as Khadar soil. As this soil is formed
due to the river floods, itis found mostly nearby the river. Generally such soil is sandy. Soil
containing old alluvium in the upper valley region of a river is called Bangar soil. It is sticky
and has dark colour. Alluvial soil is seen in many parts of the country. Their fertility is also
different at different places. Generally, such soil is very fertile. It is found in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh,
Bihar, West Bengal etc.

(2) Black Soil : This soil is found mostly in Maharashtra, western Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat,
Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Tamil Nadu. Black soil is the gift of peninsular plateau.
This soil is very sticky and fertile. It can contain humidity for a prolonged time. It is formed
from the metamorphic rocks and is very useful for cotton cultivation. That is why it has become

famous as Black Cotton Soil. It is also known as regur soil.

(3) Red Soil : Such soil is found in regions of igneous and metamorphic rocks. Its red
colour is due to its ferrous and other humus contents. The soil is porous and fertile. Such soil
is seen in Goa, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Jharkhand.

(4) Laterite Soil : Laterite soil develops as a result of excessive erosion by rain. Due
to heavy rain, the humus contents from the top soil descend into the lower strata which is
called leaching. As the soil contains less humus, it is less fertile. The red sandstones contain
iron and aluminium. The erosion of these rock results into its red colour. Such soil is found
in mountainous region of Deccan, Karnataka, Kerala, Odisha and some parts of North-East.

(5) Mountain Soils ; Humus content is more due to the forests, although it differs from
place to place. Such soil on Shivalik Range is less fertile and less developed. The soil is sandy
and porous and does not contain humus. Such soil is found in the mountainous region of the
country, such as in Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh, eastern hill ranges, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh

and Jammu-Kashmir - states.

(6) Desert Soils : Such soil is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of Gujarat, Rajasthan,
Punjab and Haryana. The soil here is more alkaline and has less humus contents. Agriculture
has been made possible in such soil only through irrigation.

Thus, a large diversity in soils of the nation is seen due to diversity in climate and relief features.

Drainage System

The word ‘drainage system, is used for the systematic pattern of rivers. While observing the
physiography of India, it is seen that one main river along with its tributaries come from different directions
and merge into a single river. The water of these rivers is emptied into a water reservoir, sea or a desert.
Thus, when a river flows through its system in any area, it is called a ‘river basin’. When a mountain or
an upland separates the flow of water from one another, it is called Water-divide.

Drainage system of India :

The drainage system of India follows its physiography. Accordingly, the drainage system of India
is divided into two parts :

(1) Himalayan Rivers (2) Peninsular Rivers

Rivers of India are divided into two zones according to the physical features. Due to this a large
difference is seen among the Himalayan and Peninsular rivers. Himalayan rivers contain water throughout
the year. These rivers are perennial because of the increase in water volume due to heavy rain during
monsoon and due to the melting of snow during summer. Two major rivers of Himalaya, Sindhu and
Brahmaputra, originate in the northern part of this mountain system. These rivers have cut deep gorges by
cutting the mountains. Himalayan rivers cross a long way from its origin to the sea.

Three stages of a river system

(1) Upper Course (2) Middle Course (3) Lower Course

When a river starts from mountainous region, it causes intense erosion. It carries huge volume

of sand and sediments along with it. Its flow decreases in its middle and lower course. Meanders are

seen here. Due to these meanderings and the impact of floods, a lake is formed in the shape

of animal’s hoof. Near its delta, a river is divided into many tributaries. This divided area

turns into a very fertile plain in a triangle shape. This is called Delta.

Peninsular rivers are seasonal because these are dependent on rain

water. During dry season,

their flow is either reduced or is totally stopped. Compared to the Himalayan rivers, their length

is also less and are also shallow. Due to the physiography and the

most of the peninsular rivers originate in the Western Ghats, flow

When streams flow out in all directions from a mountain, this type of river system

is formed. e.g. rivers of Saurashtra.

15.4 India : Major rivers and Lakes

(1) Himalayan Rivers :

Sindhu, Ganga and Brahmaputra are major rivers originating in the Himalayas. These rivers
are long and many tributaries meet them. When a large river and her many tributaries meet,
they form a shape, which is called system.

Sindhu (Indus) River System: River Sindhu emerges from near Mansarovar in Tibet. First it flows
to north and then turns westwards. There it enters Ladakh District of Jammu-Kashmir. It has formed
many inaccessible gorges. Rivers Zaskar, Nubara, Shyok and Hunza meet her. Satluj, Beas, Ravi and
Jhelum are her main tributaries. These five rivers meet river Sindhu near Mithankot in Pakistan. The
combined flow of all these rivers ultimately flows southwards and meets the Arabian Sea. These rivers
flow at a slower speed in the plain. About one third of its basin falls in the mountainous region of

Jammu- Kashmir.

e River Sindhu is 2900 km long.

In 1960, a Treaty was signed with Pakistan regarding the distribution of the water of Sindhu river.

e
e Accordingly, India can use only 20 % of its water.
e

Irrigation has been possible in Punhab, Haryana and south-western parts of Rajasthan by harnessing

the waters of Satluj, Ravi and Beas rivers.

Ganga River System : Rivers Bhagirathi and Alaknanda emerging from the Gangotri area in
Himalayas, merge with each other near Devprayag (Uttarakhand). Ganga leaves the mountainous terrain
and enters plains near Haridwar.

Many Himalayan rivers meet Ganga. Among them Ghaghra, Gandak and Kosi are major rivers.
Yamuna emerges from Yamnotri in Himalayas. Flowing to the right side of Ganga, it merges with Ganga
near Allahabad. The source of Ghaghra, Gandak and Kosi rivers lies in Nepal. Hence the northern plain
experiences flood disasters every year. There is a heavy loss of lives and property in some areas, yet India
has been able to attain prosperity in agriculture through the fertile plains formed by these rivers.

Few rivers like Chambal, Betwa originate in peninsular plateau and meet Yamuna. Son river meets
Ganga. These rivers originate in semi - arid area, their flow length is shorter and have limited volume of
water,

The combined flow of the rivers from north and south is divided ahead into two branches. One branch
enters Bangladesh and is known there as Padma. Another branch is known as Bhagirathi - Hugli in west
Bengal. Finally, these two branches meet the Bay of Bengal.

The flow of Ganga, which is known as Padma in Bangladesh, merges there with Brahmaputra river
and their combined flow is called Meghna. The Ganga - Brahmaputra delta is the most fertile delta. and
is known as Sundarvan.

Like to know...

e@ The delta region of Ganga is called ‘Sundarvan’ because the trees known as ‘sundari’ grow in large

number here.
Sundarvan delta is more famous as mangrove forests.

Total length of Ganga exceeds 2500 kilometres. Ambala City works as a water divide between
Ganga and Sindhu rivers. Ambala to Sundarvan is about 1800 km, but the slope is very gentle. Ambala
is at an altitude of 300 metres from sea level, while Sundarvan is at sea level. Considering this, the
slope happens to be less than one metre for every 6 km so there are many meanders in this river.

Brahmaputra River System: River Brahmaputra originates near Mansarovar in Tibet. Its souerce is
the near the place of origin of rivers Sindhu and Satluj. Most of its flow is out side India. This river flows in the
east parallel to Himalayan Mountain System. Near Namcha Barva, it takes ‘u’ shape turn and enters Arunachal
Pradesh. Here it is known as Dihang. This river, with Lohit and Kenula tributaries, is collectively known as
Brahmaputra in Assam.

e ‘Mazuli’, an island in Brahmaputra, is the largest riverine island in the world.

C17) Drainage System


--- PAGE 116 ---
There is less of sedimentsation in this river in Tibet. In India, the river passes through regions of
heavy rainfall. So further down there is more of water mass as well as sediments. Many tributaries meet
this river in Assam. Thus river Brahmaputra flows in a braided form.

Every year, there is a huge increase in its water as it overflows during rainy season.
As a result, devastating floods often occur in Assam and Bangladesh. There is a contrast in
this river compared to other rivers of North India. Due to heavy rains in Assam during monsoon,
there is a huge deposition. The increasing level of sand in this river brings its bed higher. So
there are frequent changes in the course of the river.

(2) Peninsular Rivers

Western Ghats is considered to be the main water divide for peninsular rivers. Major rivers of the
peninsula are Mahanadi, Godavari, Krishna, Kaveri etc. All these rivers flow eastwards and meet the Bay
of Bengal. Many rivers flow to the west of Western Ghats. Large rivers like Narmada and Tapi flow from
east to west and meet the Arabian Sea in the west.

Narmada Basin: Narmada originates near Amarkantak plateau in Madhya Pradesh. It flows
westward in a rift valley. It flows through a rocky terrain of marbles near Jabalpur, and flows faster
due to slope. The Dhuadhar Falls are located here.

Tributaries of this river do not have longer flow. Most of the rivers meet at right angles.
Its basin area is spread over Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. Narmada is about 1312 km long.

Tapi Basin :Satpuda ranges are located in Madhya Pradesh. Tapi river originates in Betul District.
It flows in arift valley, parallel to Narmada, and meets Arabian Sea. It has an extensive basin in
Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.

Coastal plain between Arabian Sea and Western Ghats is very narrow. So the rivers have
a shorter flow. Major rivers flowing westward have shorter course. Major rivers flowing westward
are Sabarmati and Mahi (Mahisagar). Tapi is almost 724 km _ long.

Godavari Basin: This is the largest of the peninsular rivers. It starts from the slopes of western
Ghats near Nasik in Maharashtra. It is about 1465 km long. It flows to the east and meets Bay of
Bengal. It has the largest basin among the peninsular rivers. About 50 % of its basin lies in Maharashtra,
and the rest is in Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh.

Many tributaries meet Godavari. Among them, Purna, Vardha, Pranhita, Manjara, Vainganga and
Penganga are major rivers. Godavari has a longer flow and a large basin, so it is also known as Ganga
of south.

Mahanadi Basin: Mahanadi originates in the mountainous area of Chhattisgarh. It flows through
Odisha and meets Bay of Bengal. It is about 860 km long and has a basin spread in Chhattisgarh,
Jharkhand and Odisha.

Krishna Basin: It originates near Mahabaleshwar in Maharashtra. It is about 1400 km _ long.
Tungbhadra, Koyna, Ghatprabha, Musi and Bhima are her major tributaries. Its basin extends in
Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.

Kaveri Basin: It has its origin in the Brahmagiri Range in Western Ghats and is about 760 km
long. Amravati, Bhavani, Hemvati and Kalini are her major tributaries. Its basin extends in. Kerala,
Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. It meets the Bay of Bengal to the south of Cuddalore in Tamil Nadu.

There are other smaller rivers which flow eastwards and meet Bay of Bengal. These

rivers include Damodar, Brahmani, Vaitarni and Suvarnarekha.

e Hydrosphere exists over about 71 % on the earth‘s surface.

e About 97 % of it is saline water.

e Only 3 % water is available as fresh water. One-fourth of its portion is in the form of ice.

Lakes

There are many lakes in India. Fresh water lakes are found more in the Himalayan region.
Most of the lakes contain water during rainy season. In Kashmir, glacial lakes are formed.
A few lakes are formed due to wind, rivers and human actions. In rivers having many meanders,
ox-bow lakes are formed. Sea tides have created ‘lagoon’ lakes. Chilka, Koleru and Pulicat are
examples of this type of lakes. Sambhar lake in Rajasthan is a saline lake and salt is produced

from it.

Himalaya has many fresh water lakes which are formed due to glacial action. Water was filled
in the depressions which led to the formation of lakes. Beautiful lakes are formed here due to melting
of snow. Wular Lake in Kashmir has a tectonic origin. Other fresh water lakes of this area are Dal,

Bhimtal, Loktal and Badapani.

Importance of lakes: Lakes are useful to man in many ways. Some rivers have originated from
lakes. In the regions which have more rain, more water can be accumulated in the lakes. The
accumulated water can be utilised for irrigation and other purposes. The stored water can also be used
during drought. Reservoirs and lakes formed due to dam are useful for generating hydel power. Few
lakes enhance the natural beauty, hence such lakes have been developed as tourist spots. Lakes are also

important for fishery and as tourist resorts.
Economic importance of rivers

Rivers have remained most important during human history. Rivers are the natural resource
of water. These are very much important for many human activities. It has satisfied basic need
of man. Agriculture and industries have developed due to rivers. Ancient civilizations also flourished
along rivers. Major cities have developed along the river banks, e.g. Delhi, Kolkata, Ahmedabad,

Bharuch, Surat etc.

River is considered to be the base for an agrarian country like India. In recent times, river water

is utilised for drinking, irrigation, hydel power and for navigation.
River — pollution

River water is used more in domestic activities, agriculture and in industrial production. We
know the rivers as “‘Lokmata’, consider it to be very holy, and yet we release industrial effluents
in the rivers. The sewage water is dumped into the river near the city. Besides, we also
throw solid waste in the river. As a result, the river water is polluted. Thus, water pollution
increases due to industrialization and urbanization. Pollution of river water has become our national
problem. Government is putting in special efforts to prevent river pollution. At this stage, public

participation is equally expected along with the government’s efforts.

Measures to prevent water pollution

Rules to prevent water pollution should be implemented very strictly. Water purification projects

must be implemented through National River Conservation Project. Strict rules should be formed
to prevent industrial units from releasing industrial effluents in the rivers. Industrial units should
filter harmful contents from the chemical effluents before releasing them in the river. In order to keep the

river water clean, every citizen should take care not to mix up the domestic waste into the river.

Climate is an average of atmospheric conditions over a long period. Generally, climate is
determined from the average weather conditions of summer, winter and rainy season of a place
for about 35 years or more. In short, climate is an average of long term atmospheric conditions.

Weather is an average of short term conditions of atmosphere. Weather can change at any time
during a day. Change in weather conditions depends on air temperature, air pressure, humidity, rain, fog
or amount of clouds etc. Weather affects our daily agricultural activities. Indian Meteorological
Department publishes a daily weather map anda Report of the entire nation.

India shows a large diversity and characteristics in climatic conditions. Seasons change in some
parts of the earth according to the wind direction. So the winds which change their direction according
to the season are called ‘Monsoon winds’. These winds are so named after the Arabic word ‘Mausim’.
India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Myanmar are Asian countries which experience monsoon
climate.

Seasonal changes

Revolution of the earth around the sun and her axial tilt are major reasons for changes
in seasons. The axis of the earth is tilted at 23.5° and makes an angle of 66.5° with the
orbit. Seasons are caused due to the axial tilt. Regions receiving more sun light experience summer
Owhile regions receiving less sun light experience winter. Sun rays fall vertically over Tropic
of Capricorn on 22™ December, so the southern hemisphere experiences summer and the northern
hemisphere experiences winter. Nights in India are longer and colder in winter. Similarly, the sun rays are
vertical over Tropic of Cancer on 21* June, so the days are longer.

16.1 Changing Seasons

Rotation and revolution of the earth have a direct impact on the food, clothing and residences of
man. In monsoonal countries like India, the winter and summer monsoon winds which change direction
according to the season, affect the seasonal weather, and give peculiar characteristics to the weather
of every season. That is why the climate is called ‘monsoonal climate’.

Variations in the climates of India

There are many verilations in the climate of India. South India has a peninsular shape,
hence it experiences moderate maritime climate, while the climate becomes more continental while
going away from the sea shore. A large part of North India is away from the sea coast
so it experiences continental climate. The Tropic of Cancer passes almost through middle of

of the country, e.g. the temperature in Leh and Dras in north in Kashmir is as low as -45°
C during winter. Sri Ganganagar and Alwar in Rajasthan record 51°C high temperature during
summer. Similarly, Cherrapunji in Meghalaya in East India gets about 1200 cm rainfall annually
which is maximum in the world. Mawsinram, about 16 km away from Cherrapunji, is famous
for receiving maximum rainfall during twenty four hours. In the west, the deserts of Rajasthan receive
only 10 to 12 cm rainfall annually. Contradicting climatic conditions are seen in our country when
one region has devastating floods while the other faces drought due to intense heat and scanty
or absence of rainfall. Some regions face devastating effects of thunderstorms, sandstorms and
tropical cyclones. Thus seasonal weather has diversified effects.

Factors affecting the climate

There are some factors on the surface of the earth which control the distribution and amount
of elements of climate. These are called climatic factors. Following factors affect the climate
of India.

Latitude: Climatic type on the surface of the earth changes according to the latitude of the place
concemed. There is a distance of about 111kilometres between two successive latitudes. Sun rays fall
vertically over equatorial region hence it is very hot throughout the year. India is divided into two zones
of different climatic conditions, viz. torrid zone and temperate zone.

Distance from sea : The distance of landmass from sea is another important factor affecting the
climate. Water and land have different capacity to conserve and release the solar heat. As a result,
coastal regions experience temperate climate, while the climate becomes continental in the interior places
away from sea coast. The climate of Mumbai in India is temperate as it is near the sea coast, while
it is continental at Nagpur or Delhi as these places are far away from sea.

Altitude : As we go higher in the atmosphere from sea level , air pressure and air temperature
decrease, while higher relief gets more rain. Due to the high altitude, the Himalayan peaks remain snow
covered throughout the year. Moist air cools down when it rises and gives rain. With increasing altitude
of the mountains in Meghalaya, the rainfall increases. In general, air temperature decreases @ 1°C for
the ascent of 165 metres or by 6.5°C for an ascent of every 1000 metres from the surface of the earth.

Atmospheric pressure and winds : India falls in the path of north- east trade winds. These
winds originate due to tropical high pressure belt in northern hemisphere. These winds deflect due to
coriolis force and blow towards equator. In past, these winds were utilised for oceanic trade, so these
are called ‘Trade Winds’. As these winds blow over landmass, they contain less moisture. The Indian
Ocean is located to the south of India, Arabian Sea lies to the west and bay of Bengal is in the east.
Due to this vast water mass, the winds passing over them absorb moisture and bring rain in India.

During winter, high pressure develops to the north of Himalayas. Cold and dry winds from this
region blow towards the oceanic area where low pressure is created. During summer, low pressure
develops due to high temperature over central Asia and Indian landmass. At this time, high pressure
prevails over Indian Ocean in south, so winds tend to blow from the high pressure over Indian Ocean
to low pressure in North India. These winds are known as * South-West Monsoon Winds’. They contain
moisture and bring rain in India.

Sometimes a peculiar phenomena takes place over places located far from India which creates
temporary changes in the long term climatic pattern. Phenomena like Jet Stream, Western
Disturbances, El- Nino, I.T.C.Z. have affected the Indian weather to a great extent. However, the
monsoonal characteristics of climate of India remain unaffected.

Seasons of India

Weather in our country remains almost the same for every two months. These two months
duration is called ‘season’. As per tradition, there are six seasons in India. These are : Hemant,
Shishir, Vasant, Grishma, Varsha and Sharad. There is hardly any noticeable difference in the
weather between two successive seasons. So if two seasons are taken simultaneously, then there
would be only three seasons of the year : (1) Cold season (2) Hot season (3) Rainy season.
Changes in seasons are experienced distinctly in India. Cold weather starts with the beginning
of winter. Temperature gradually increases during summer. With the onset of monsoon, air gathers
moisture and brings rain.

Indian Meteorological Department of Government of India at Delhi has divided the climate of
India into four seasons :

(1) Cold Weather season — Winter — December to February
(2) Hot Weather season — Summer — March to May
(3) Advancing Monsoon — Rainy season — June to September

(4) Retreating Monsoon season — October to November

Cold Weather season — Winter (December to February)

In India, the three months’ duration from December to February is considered as_ winter.
Sun shines vertically over the southern hemisphere between 22" September to 21% March. India
is situated in northern hemisphere, so it is under the influence of slant sun rays between
December to February and low temperature prevails. Winds blow from north-east direction from
Central Asia. These winds are dry and cold, so the weather also remains dry and cold. The
sky during this season generally remains clear ( cloudless).

North-East India remains comparatively cooler as it is far away from the sea and some part
of it is a desert. During winter this region develops high pressure and this deflects the winds.Dry and
cool winds are generated due to the high pressure. These winds reduce the temperature of the places
over which they blow. In Delhi, temperature often goes below 10° c during winter and it remains around
16° c in Allahabad and 18°c in Kolkata. At this time the temperature in Himalayas is much less. The
January temperature of Shimla, Darjeeling is around 5° c. After the snowfall in Himalayas, the cold and
heavy winds rush towards the North Indian plains. As a result, this plain along with Gujarat and
Rajasthan are under the grip of cold wave. Temperature decreases suddenly. Frost in some area
destructs the cotton crop. Temperature does not fall below freezing point during winter except for the
high mountainous regions, because the Central Himalayas obstruct the extremely cold winds coming from
Central Asia and protects India from severe cold.

Let us know certain weather terms appearing frequently in the newspapers in India....
Jet Stream
In both hemispheres around 30° latitudes, very powerful winds in a pipe shaped belt blow
with high speed in the atmosphere at an altitude of 8 to 15 km. These winds are known
as ‘Jet Streams’. Their average velocity is about 150 km/per hour and in the central part

of this wind belt, their velocity is about 400 km. During winter these winds blow over the
southern slopes of Himalayas and in summer, these are stationed over peninsular India. High

altitude winds help to bring rain.
Western Disturbances

Jet Stream formed over West Asia blows towards east and affects West Asian countries,
North-East India, Pakistan and Afghanistan. The dust storms accompanying these disturbances

leave their effect up to Bangladesh. This often creates disturbances in the pleasant winter weather
of North India. Very high mountains receive snowfall and the plains receive some rain which
is useful to the Ravi crop. This may cause unseasonal rain, locally known as ‘mavthu’, in

Gujarat which may damage crops.

Conditions in South India during winter are different from those in North India. South India is
situated in torrid zone, near the equator and has a peninsular shape. Its inner area is not
very far from sea coast. So this area does not feel severe cold as the Northern India during
winter. There is no snowfall. Temperature also does not go down very low, e.g. the temperature
at Kochi during January is around 26°C, Madurai is 25°C and Chennai is 24°C but the mountainous
area in South India feel low temperature. Temperature decreases towards north. In India winter
is considered to be very pleasant and healthy season. Due to longer and cooler nights, dew
and fog are common in early morning. Day is shorter and night is longer. In winter, dry winds
coming from over landmass generally do not bring rain, but North-East winds coming over from
Bay of Bengal contain humidity. These winds give more rainfall over the Coromandel coast.
North-east gets some rainfall due to the western disturbances and thunder storms. This rain is
very useful for the Ravi crop in Punjab and Haryana. These winds give rain in Gujarat occasionally.
This unseasonal rain in Gujarat is locally called ‘mavthu’.

Let us know some frequently used words in the newspapers about Indian weather...
(El-Nino)
This is a Spanish word which literary means a ‘small child’. The name was given by
Peruvian fishermen after the child Jesus, because its impact is generally felt around Christmas.

This warm current originates to the west of Peru along the Pacific coast in South America
due to atmospheric and oceanic conditions. This current flows westwards and its impact is
felt up to India. The El-Nino phenomena takes place occasionally. Whenever it takes place, changes
occur in the duration of monsoon and amount of rainfall in India.
(ITCZ)
A large low pressure area develops over the equator where the Trade Winds converge.
It is called Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The Trade winds rise upwards in the
form of air currents. In July this Convergence zone is stationed over 20° to 25° north latitude.
In India, it is stable over Ganga plains. Due to the low pressure developed over this region,
winds generated over the oceans in southern hemisphere blow towards this area, causing rain
in few parts of North India. During colder season, the Convergence zone, shifts further south,
so the winds change their direction to north-east.

Warm Weather season — summer (Grishma_ season)

In India the warm and dry season between March to May is called ‘Summer’. During this
period the sun rays fall vertically from south to north gradually and the landmass becomes
warmer. Temperature increases continuously. The month of March is the hottest month in southern
India. Temperature exceeds 40°C at many places. Central and North-East India experience maximum
temperature during April and May. At some places, the temperature reaches around 45°C to
50°C. Thus, entire nation experiences very high temperature during summer. Due to the altitude
of peninsula and the plateau, the summer in south India is little mild. Compared to North India,
the temperature here remains low. While the temperature in Delhi and Allahabad is 34° C, it
is 30°C at Madurai and 27°C at Bengaluru. Thus physical features and sea seem to have dominating
effects on the temperature in south.

Like to know...
Norwester
The low pressure pocket over north and north-east India is spread upto Bihar due to which
some parts of Odisha and Jharkhand become more hot occasionally. It is known as Norwester.
These winds are known as ‘kaal Baisakhi’ locally and cause much damage in eastern India.
Loo
In the arid regions of west and north-west India, sandstorms or thunderstorms are common. In

summer, especially in May, very hot winds blow over North India which are known as ‘Loo’. Due

to the excessive heat many people and animals die.

During this season, tropical cyclones develop over Bay of Bengal and over Arabian Sea, advance
towards coastal area and cause devastating effects over coastal regions. Most of the country experiences
hot and dry weather during summer. Most of the places do not receive any rain in this season, but sometimes
Malabar coast gets some rain which helps the mango crop. So it is called ‘AmraVrushti’. This is useful
to mango and coffee crops.

The Advancing Monsoon (Rainy season — June to September)

India is an agrarian country and so the rainy season is very important season for India.
About 80 % of the rainfall country is received between June to September. Indian farmer is busy
in farming from the beginning of the rainy season. South-West monsoon winds are responsible

(125) Climate


--- PAGE 124 ---
for the rain in this season and the humid and cloudy weather. That is why this is also known
as season of ‘ South-West Monsoon winds’. Almost entire India gets rainfall due to these winds.

By the end of May, a low pressure develops due to high temperature over India and Central Asia.
At this time, Indian Ocean in the south develops high pressure, so winds blow towards northern low

pressure pockets. The summer monsoon winds blow from the ocean towards India. As these winds are
moisture laden, they bring rain.

16.3 India : South-West Advancing Monsoon

Due to the peninsular shape of South India, the South-West monsoon winds are divided

into two
parts : (1) Arabian Sea Current, and (2) Bay of Bengal Current.

Social Science, 9 (126)


--- PAGE 125 ---
Generally the monsoon in India starts in the beginning of June at Kerala in South India. Western
Ghats obstruct the south-west monsoon winds coming over from Arabian Sea. So the entire coast
on western slopes of the Ghats receives heavy rain. When these winds cross Western Ghats and
reach the peninsular plateau, most of its moisture is reduced. Hence this leeward region gets less
rain. Mumbai gets more than 200 cm rain while Pune, which is little farther, gets about 75 cm_ rain.

Rain decreases northwards from Kerala to Karnataka, Goa and Maharashtra on western coast.
One branch of this current enters Madhya Pradesh through the Narmada valley. This current
further merges with the winds coming over from Bay of Bengal. One branch of this Arabian
current passes over Gujarat, Saurashtra, and Kachchh and advances towards Rajasthan. There

are no high mountains or dense forests in Gujarat, so there is less possibility of the condensation
of their moisture in these winds. After giving rain in Gujarat, when these winds enter Rajasthan,
they contain less moisture so Rajasthan gets less rain.Deserts get even less than 10cm _ rainfall.

Bay of Bengal Current

Second branch of the south—west monsoon winds first enters West Bengal and then reaches
up to Meghalaya. These winds contain maximum moisture which give heavy rain in Meghalaya.
The slopes of Khasi, Garo and Jaintia hills receive heavy rainfall. Winds here deflect and blow
from south-east. They cross over West Bengal, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and reach Haryana.
Their moisture content decreases, so the regions which fall in its way first get more rainfall
and gradually the last regions get less rainfall. Further, both these currents, coming from Arabian
Sea and Bay of Bengal, merge giving good amount of rain in northern Himalayan region. Snowfall
occurs there occasionally.

Along with the monsoon winds, cyclones originating over the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian
Sea also enter India. Due to this, monsoon becomes more active in some area. During monsoon
season, an average of five to six cyclones pass through India and help in bringing rainfall. India
receives her rain through monsoon winds. But these winds do not blow throughout the year and
from the same direction. The onset of these winds is also irregular. The phenomena of ‘Rain
Break’ is associated with the monsoon winds. The monsoon rain falls for many days , but
there are few rainless days and again it is followed by a spell of rain. This phenomena is
called Rain break. There is also a variation in the physical features in our country. All these
factors affect the distribution of rainfall. These factors have made the amount and the distribution
of rainfall unequal in India. Assam and Meghalaya receive very heavy rainfall while the deserts
in Rajasthan and Leh in Kashmir receive insignificant rain.

Retreating Monsoon (October — November)

Duration between October and November is better known as Retreating Monsoon. The vertical
sunrays gradually shift southwards and create low pressure over Indian Ocean in south. High
pressure develops gradually over North India. By the end of September a fresh pressure system
develops over Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal which weakens the monsoon winds which have
already reached the interior part of India. When the pressure conditions change afterwards, these
winds start flowing back towards the sea during October - November. So this period is called
season of ‘Retreating Monsoon’. At this time, a season of dry and cool winds starts instead
of hot summer. Clear sky and increasing temperature are main characteristics of retreating monsoon
winds. Soil contains moisture, day time temperature increases, night is cool and pleasant. Day time
weather is very perplexing due to high temperature and humidity. This situation is known as ‘October
Heat’. In Gujarat, it is locally known as ‘Bhadarvi Taap’.

Climate and Human Life

The climate of India is of monsoonal type. Irregularity and uncertainty are its characteristics which
have a profound impact on climate and the food, life style, nature of people and agriculture. Besides being
an agrarian country, India is under the total control of monsoon climate. So the impact of all the uncertainties
of these monsoon winds is seen on the agriculture and human life in India. Following are the major impacts
of climate on human life.

Due to high temperature during most of the year in India, a large variety of crops can be
cultivated. But the uncertainty of rains has resulted into unpredictable production. Most of the
rain falls between. June and September. So where irrigation is not possible, only one crop can
be taken depending on rainfall. The beginning as well as end of rainy season is uncertain, so many a

Social Science, 9 (128)

times, water is not available to crops at proper time. This delay causes destruction of seeds
and crop production. Sometimes there is a heavy downpour of rain in shorter time. This also destroys
crops. Rivers get flooded and cause soil erosion which in long term reduces crop production.
When the rainy season is over, it creates employment problems for agricultural labourers. As the
farming is not a year long work, many agricultural labourers migrate to cities. Due to irregular
rain, some agro-based industries face problems as they do not get their raw material like cotton,
sugarcane, tobacco etc. Problem of drinking water also becomes acute due to irregular rain.
Life in desert or mountainous region becomes full of hardships, which directly affects people’s
food, clothing, occupation etc.

Natural Vegetation

Vegetation is an important part of human life. It is difficult to imagine life without vegetation.
Its importance has been accepted by our ancient scriptures and by modern science.

India has a large diversity of natural vegetation. In terms of vegetation diversity, India holds tenth position
in the world and fourth in Asia. A forest is a group of trees, and those trees which grow in natural

condition without human help are called Forest.
Natural Vegetation
The diversity in natural vegetation of India is created due to the following reasons
(1) Relief features (2) Soil (3) Temperature (4) Insolation (sunshine) (5) Rainfall (6) Humidity

Due to the diversified relief like mountains, plateaus, plains, deserts etc. a diverse pattern
in vegetation is seen in India. There are different soils e.g. alluvial, black, mountain, desert type
etc. in India. This variation in soils also creates differences in vegetation. The difference in temperature
and humidity in cold Himalayan regions and in southern peninsular region also bring variations in
vegetation. The insolation over any place depends on its latitude and altitude. Vegetation grows
faster where there is more rain and insolation. Thus, there is a diversity in vegetation due to
sunshine. Rainfall distribution in India is also unequal which in turn causes diversity in vegetation.

There are about 5000 varieties of trees in India, out of which 450 trees are useful commercially.
Besides, about 15,000 flowering plants also grow which form about 6 % of the world. Non-flowering
plants like fern, algae, moss etc. are also available in our country. India is famous since ancient times for
the herbal plants. About 2000 medicinal plants are described in Ayurved. Thus it can be said that India
has a diversity in vegetation.

Types of Natural Vegetation

Existence and growth of any vegetation depends on the climate of a region. In the regions
of identical climate, the vegetation seen is mostly identical. Regions of such ecological similarities

are called natural Vegetation Regions.

On the basis of altitude, soils, rainfall and differential temperature, the natural vegetation regions can
be divided into five types :

(1) Tropical Rain Forests (2) Tropical Deciduous Forests (3) Tropical Desert Vegetation
(4) Temperate Forests and Grasslands (5) Mangrove (Tidal) Forests.
(1) Tropical Rain Forests :

Distribution : Tropical Rain Forests are found in hot and humid regions where annual rainfall
exceeds 200 cm and temperature is more than 22°C. Such forests are found in area of heavy rainfall of
Western Ghats, Lakshadweep, Andaman — Nicobar Islands, upper regions of Assam, coastal Tamil Nadu.

Trees : Trees found here are Mahogany, Ebony, Rosewood, rubber etc.

Characteristics : Trees here are about 60 metres tall or even more. There is more humidity due
to scrubs. There is no season here like autumn. As these trees are evergreen, the forests are also called
Evergreen Forests.

(2) Tropical Deciduous Forests :

Distribution : Generally, such forests are found in the regions receiving about 70 to 200 cm
rainfall. Such forests are found in North-Eastern States, Himalayan foothills. Western Odisha, Chhattisgarh,
Jharkhand, eastern slopes of Eastern Ghats, Vindhya and Satpuda ranges. There is a large proportion
of these forests in India.

Trees : Major trees found here are teak, saal, sesame, sandalwood, kher ( acacia catechu)
bamboo etc.

Characteristics : A major characteristic of the trees here is that the trees shed their leaves for
6 to 8 weeks during autumn. Every species has a different time to shed the leaves, so all the trees are
never without leaves during any particular season. As these trees shed their leaves according to seasons,
these are also called Monsoon forests.

(3) Tropical Desert Vegetation :

Distribution : Generally, such forests are foundin the regions receiving less than 70 cm of rainfall.
These are found in North-Western region, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh etc.

Trees : Dates, jujube, acacia, cactus, khijdo etc. are common trees found here.

Characteristics ; The roots of the trees and plants here are long, deep and widespread. Leaves are
shorter which result in slower evapotranspiration process.

(4) Temperate Forests and Grasslands (Himalayan Vegetation) :

A major characteristic of the coniferous forests is that the trees have conical shape. Their
branches lean towards the surface so that the snow would easily slide down towards the land.

Tree leaves are long, pointed and sticky which can conserve humidity for longer time
(5) Tidal Forests (Mangroves) :

Distribution : Tidal forests are located in the delta regions of rivers along the coast. These
forests are found along Gujarat coast and in the marshy lands along the Bay of Bengal coast.
Trees : Sundari and cher.

Forest products and their utility

Forests are useful to mankind in many ways. Timber wood from teak and saal is used for furniture
making. Boats are prepared from the wood of sundari trees of Sundarvan. Sports goods and packing boxes
are prepared from the wood of pine and chid trees. Turpentine is prepared from the liquid from chid trees.
Sandalwood is used to prepare perfumed oil, cosmetics etc. Baskets, toys, goods of home decoration etc.
are made from bamboo trees. Forests also provide lac (sealing wax), resin, gum, rubber, honey, cane etc.
Amla (embellicmyrobalan), baheda, harde, ashvagandha etc. hold medicinal utility.

Medicinal Utility of Vegetation

Besides leaf plates from khakhro leaves, catechu from kher tree, bidi from timru leaves are

also prepared. Forests provide livelihood and food to forest dwellers. This way, forests contribute
into the social and economic development of mankind.

Environmental Importance of Forests
The environmental importance of forests is as follows

Forests are useful to bring rain.

They controls the atmosphere from becoming adverse.
They provide life saving oxygen.

Forests control the floods.

They absorb harmful gases like carbon dioxide.
Forests prevent soil erosion.

Forests maintain ground water.

Forests restrict the advancing deserts.

Forests are useful in reducing air pollution.
Forests enhance the natural beauty.

Forests purify the air.

Forests are ideal places for adventurous, tourism activities.
e@ Some forests are reserved with reference to National Parks and Sanctuaries and bio diversity.
Forest conservation

Ecosystem is formed due to the interrelation of biosphere and mankind. But due to the
anti-environmental activities and selfishness of man, the ecosystem is disturbed. Man’s insatiable

Social Science, 9 (134)


--- PAGE 133 ---
desire to procure land is responsible for the destruction of forests. Forests are destroyed also
by increasing population, policy of establishing industrial units away from residential areas, urbanization,
multi-purpose projects, construction of roads, jhoom cultivation, to get timber and fuel wood, forest
fire etc. Ecological balance is disrupted due to the destruction of forests.

Adverse effects are noticed due to forest destruction. These include decrease in rainfall, drought,
global warming, green house effects, advancing deserts, homelessness of wild animals etc.

According to the National Policy of 1952, there must be forests over 33 % of the total geographical
area of the nation. In India, forests are spread over about 23 % area while forests occupy only about 10
% of land in Gujarat. Thus, itis necessary to prevent destruction of forests, and so protection and
conservation of forests is necessary.

In Gujarat, white khakhro, gugal, nilsoti, sesame, amli, attak, harde etc. are placed in Red

data Book of I.U.C.N. (International Union for Conservation of Nature) in “on verge of extinction’
category.

Remedies to conserve forests :

In order to protect and conserve forests, The Government of India implemented a National Forest Policy
in 1952. In 1980, the parliament passed Legislative Act and in 1988 a new National Policy was announced.
Following steps should be taken to preserve forests.

(1) Forests are our nation's resource. Take it as our moral duty to protect them.
(2) Tree felling should be stopped. Heavy punishment must be inflicted to those who cut trees illegally.

(3) To increase public participation in Van Mahotsav and Social Forestry, trees must be planted on either
sides of waste land, river, railway tracks and roads and raise them.

(4) Create awareness about environment through environmental education and school syllabus,
celebrate environment related days.

(5) Take precautions to avoid forest fire, and in case of fire it must be doused immediately.

(6) Use renewable energy resources such as solar energy, bio energy, wind energy etc. in place of
traditional resources like wood used to get energy.

(7) Explain the importance of forests to people through broadcasting media, and bring public awareness
about it.

Wild Life

India has a diversified relief and climate. Similar diversity is seen here in the wild life.
In the entire world, about 15 lakh species of wild life are recorded of which 81, 251 species
are found in India. These include reptiles, mammals, fish and other insects. Explorations continue
to identify other animals found in different forests. India is at sixth position among the countries

rich in bio-diversity.
India has less forest cover. Compared to that its wild life diversity is noticeable.
Zoo — Geographic Regions of India

Natural vegetation Regions have been devised on the basis of their characteristics. Similarly,
a spatial distribution can be made for animals. The wild life of India is divided into 9 zones
according to the similarities in their characteristics and their existence in any region : These are

as follows

(1) Himalayas (2) Ladakh and dry cold area (3) Forest cover in lower Himalayas (4) High lands
without forest cover in Upper Himalayas (5) Northern Plain (6) Desert of Rajasthan (7) Peninsular
Plateau (8) Sea coast and (9) Nilgiri Hills

Bio — diversity is studied according to these Zoo — Geographical regions.
The diversified Wild Life of India

The vast alluvial plains of rivers, peninsular plateau, mountainous regions, swampy areas, sea coasts,
dense rain forests, deciduous forests, coniferous forests in Himalayas and other higher regions form a vast
background for the habitation of wild life in India. The animals seen are Asian elephant in peninsular rain
forests, one horned rhino in swampy Brahmaputra river, snow leopards in higher Himalayas, wild goats and
musk deer in Jammu — Kashmir, wild buffalo Undian Bison ), tiger in Central India and West Bengal,
Ghudkhar (wildass) in Little Rann of Kachchh and flamingo in water logged Greater Rann. Presence
of Great India Bustard in the grassland area is noted again. In the water lodged area, migratory
birds from cold regions come down in great number. These include Siberian crane, pelican, Tibetian
duck, kunj, karkara etc. Flying squirrels are seen in the dense forests of Western Ghats. Nicobari dove
is a rare bird seen in Nicobar island. Rare species of corals are seen in the Gulf of Kachchh
and Lakshadweep Islands. Along with mammals and many types of birds, notice should be taken
of king cobra, snakes, python, iguana (patlagho) also. Along sea coasts and other water bodies,
various fishes, sea snakes, dolphin, shark, dugang (sea cow), octopus, whale etc. form a part of animal

world.

Besides forests, animals like fox, wolf, nilgai, deer, mongoose, rabbits, wild hog, hedgehog are seen in
agricultural areas. Many birds such as nightingale, parrot, peacock, weaver bird, chibari, pilak, vulture,

kabar, dhor bagla etc. are also seen roaming in these areas.

Wild Life and the need for conservation

While going through the past, it becomes evident that there is a danger to the existence
of the wild life since last few decades. Before one hundred years thousands of tigers were
seen in India. As per the figures of 2014 given by Forest and Environment Ministry, the
figure is 2226. Tigers have grown in numbers which is evident from the imprints of their foot
taken during last few years. This is a good sign. Vultures are on verge of becoming extinct
due to eating the meat which becomes polluted by diclofenac drug used in the treatment of
sick milch cattle. Leopards, seen in the forests in the beginning of twentieth century have become
extinct from India. Once the Asiatic Lions of Gir which were seen even upto middle east, are
now restricted to Gir forests only. With due steps taken for their protection, now their number
is 523. Once cranes were seen in large number in Gujarat, but now their number is reduced.
Wild life is an inseparable part of the living organisms, but the decrease in their numbers somewhere
and for some years reduces the quality of environment, which is a matter of concern. Shyam
Garud (eagle), a resident of mountainous forests in Gujarat is now rarely seen. Chilotro, seen
in the forests of Vijaynagar taluka, is rarely seen to-day.

It is obvious that endless human greed and the run for progress, have made environment imbalanced
which would bring adverse results. Still there is time. If proper actionis not taken then the next generation

would see the wild life only in pictures.

Dangers to Wild Life

A question mark has been put against the existence of entire wild life due to the human
greed and development in recent times. On examining the reasons, it is understood that the wild
life has become unprotected as they have lost their natural habitat due to continuously decreasing
forests. Hunting, carried out to get skin, meat, teeth, hair and bones, is a big problem. Due to
heavy grazing by domestic animals in the forests, herbivores are deprived of their food which
results in decrease in their numbers. It will deprive carnivores of getting their food. So _ these
carnivores reach human settlements in search of food and attack animals. As they approach human
settlements, situation of conflict arises between wild animals and human settlements. This conflict leads
the destruction of wild life. Besides, their effects on pollution is also very adverse due to human activities.

There is a sharp decrease in the number of domestic sparrows.
Lion is the State Animal and flamingo is State Bird of Gujarat.
Asiatic Lion, Ghudkhar (wild ass) and Patti lizard are found only in Gujarat in India.

Wild buffalo (Indian bison), elephant, cheetah, large Indian squirrel, tiger etc. have become extinct

in Gujarat.

Desert Sanctuary of Kachchh has the largest area among the sanctuaries in Gujarat.

Porbandar Bird Sanctuary is the smallest sanctuary in Gujarat.

Due to the decrease in the forest area, the wild animals occasionally come within the human
habitation. Human interference in areas of wild animal results into clashes with them. In such
incidences, wild animals become victim of human rage and lose their lives. In South and South-
Eastern India, elephants coming to search for food create havoc in the agricultural fields. Incidences
of injuring or killing men by leopards take place in Saurashtra and South Gujarat and by wolf
in the forests of north-eastern Gujarat. A precaution is necessary to prevent such disasters.

Remedies to conserve Wild Life

A long term planning is necessary to conserve and increase forest areas. We shall have
to be more dedicated to implement strong legal provisions and their strict implementation for the
conservation of forest areas and wild animals. Various social NGOs should give this a top priority
and arrange public awareness programmes. These problems should be included in the school syllabus
and make the future citizens aware. Before implementing any developmental project, its probable
effects on environment and living organisms should be examined. Cutting of large trees outside
the forests area should be stopped, because the hollow space within them and their branches are
nesting place for birds. Ponds, farm ponds and wetlands, which are necessary for migratory birds
and for those which are habited near any water body, should be protected. An active work is
urgently needed to reduce pollution. To manage the forest fire an anticipatory planning should
be made for patrolling and safety.

Steps taken to nurture the Wild Life

Since early times, laws have been framed in our country to protect the wild life. Laws
were framed to protect wild life in the time of great Maurya King Ashok. Fundamental Duties
of citizens and Directive Principles in the constitution also include these things. Parliament has passed
a Wild Life Conservation Act according to the recommendations of Indian Wild Life Board. In
2014, there were 503 Sanctuaries, 102 National Parks and 14 bio — reserves. Of these, 22 sanctuaries,
4 national parks and 1 bio reserve zone happen to be in Gujarat. Some protection schemes are
planned for those species which are on verge of extinction. Let us know about some of these projects.

Project Tiger : This Project was launched in 1973 against hunting and decreasing number of
tigers. This was implemented for 9 reserved areas, under which now 48 areas are covered.

Lion Project : There was atime when Asiatic Lions were found up to Iran in the Asian
subcontinent. Due to hunting and the reduction in forest area, these lions are now restricted to Gir
forests of Saurashtra Peninsula. At one stage, their number had gone below 100. In 1972, a project was
started in Gir to protect the Asiatic Lions. As a result of this Project and the timely taken steps, there
are now 523 lions according to the Lion Census heldin 2015.

In addition to this, there are other projects also. Major projects among them are Hangool Project
for the rare species of Barasinga deer in Kashmir, Crocodile Project for saline water crocodiles, Rhino
Project for the protection of Indian Rhino and Snow Leopard Project.

India : Human Life

We are proud that we are born in India. Our country is situated on the southern side of Asia. It
has been gifted by three seasons, cold season, warm season and rainy season with traditional sub
divisions of these seasons. Earlier you studied that India is a diversified country with reference to relief
features and climate. So many changes are seen in food, dressing, dwellings, language, dialects, festivals,
holy days etc. Thus India is a multi-coloured nation showing unity in diversity.

Relief and climate have a clear impact on the food and dress, e.g. the staple food of people living
near sea coast is rice and fish. Wheat is the main crop in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Punjab. So
people in these regions use wheat preparations. Similarly relief and climate have a strong impact on the
dressing. The costume of people in colder and mountainous region is woollen and covers entire body.
Similarly people living in a region experiencing high temperature throughout the year put on cotton dresses
which are light in colour and are loose. Nowadays men put on pant and shirt and women put on salwar
— kameez in every state.

India can be divided into four zones according to life style: Western India, Northern India, Southern
India and Eastern India. Now we shall learn about the life style in respective regions.

Life style : Western India

Major states of Western India are Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Goa. It
also includes Union Territories of Diu-Daman, Dadra and Nagar Haveli.

Food: Staple food in Rajasthan is millet and dal-bati. Marwadi kachori of Rajasthan is a famous
item in breakfast. Rotli-bhakhari, vegetables, dal and rice, khichdi and kadhi are main items in the food of
Gujarati people. Khaman and ganthia are more preferred as savoury item. Maharashtrians prefer sev-usal.
People living along the sea coasts of Gujarat, Maharashtra and Goa eat mainly rice and fish.

Like to know...

Gujaratis are basically traders. As they are required to go to distant places for trading, so durable items
for breakfast like thepla, ganthia, dry kachori, khakhro and sukhdi are more common among them.

Dress : Rajasthan isadry and desert area hence there is less diversity in vegetation. This defect
is overcome by them through colourful dresses. Men generally wear dhoti, angarakhun and colourful
head gear ( Paghadi ), while women put on sari, petticoat and blouse. Traditional dress of men in
Maharashtra is dhoti and paheran, anda cap or a head gear on the head. Women wear sari in
Maharashtrian way. The traditional dress in Madhya Pradesh is similar to that of the neighbouring states
of Gujarat and Maharashtra. In Goa also, men wear dhoti and paheran, and women wear sari, petticoat and
blouse. However, a strong western impact is seen in the dresses in Goa. Thus, every region has its own
characteristics in their dresses.

Traditional dressing of Gujarat : Men put on dhoti, Kurta, white cap or headgear (turban) on head, while
women put on sari, petticoat and blouse. The traditional attire for men in Maharashtra is dhoti and paheran and
cap or turban on head, while women put on sari in typical Maharashtrian style. The tradittional dressing of people
in Madhya Pradesh resembles very much to the neighbouring states Maharashtra and Gujarat. In Goa also, men
put on dhoti and paheran, while women put on sari, petticoat and blouse. However, a westrn effect is distinctly
seen on dressing in Goa. Thus, every region has a traditional characteristies regarding its dressing.

Dwelling : There is less rainfallin Rajasthan due to deserts, so most of the houses have flat top.
Rural people live in the houses made of grass and soil. People in Gujarat live in modern types of buildings
made from brick -— cement. In Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Goa also, urban people live in well laid
out houses with many modern amenities. In every state, the forest dwellers living in forests or mountainous
area stay in scattered huts. Roofs of the buildings in Konkan, which receives heavy rainfall, are slant.

Disaster Management

A disaster may be natural or man - induced, may be catastrophic or diastrophic, may have originated
in the interior of the earth or in atmosphere, it is felt over extensive area on the earth and also results in
devastation. If we examine a few phenomena, it will be clear that a disaster damages lives and property
to a great extent. Some events like volcanic eruption, earthquake, tsunami etc. are the collective result of
both natural as well as man — induced acts.

Some events bring pre-planned devastation and destruction, e.g. atomic attack by U.S. bombers over
Hiroshima and Nagasaki cities of Japan in the second world war, whereas some events are results of human
negligence or mistakes. e.g. Bhopal Gas Tragedy, Chernobil Atomic Disaster of Russia.

Types of Disasters :

We are aware of the risks of disasters. To decide the strategy for relief work. it is necessary to know
the reasons and responsible situations. It is important to know these with reference to overall preparation
for relief work. Experts on Disaster Management have divided the disasters into two catagories :

(1) Natural Disasters : These include flood, cyclone, tsunami, drought, earthquake, volcano, forest
fire etc. Of these, a forecast is possible for floods. cyclone, tsunami and drought, while it is not possible
to forecast earthquake, volcanic eruption. forest fire.

(2) Man - induced Disasters : Here fire, industrial accidents, bomb explosions, riots etc. are included.

(1) Natural Disasters :

Flood : By flood, we generally mean an extensive land area remaining submerged under water
continuously for several days. People associate flood with river, when river water overflows its banks and
the nearby land area comes under water. Flood is a natural event and is the result of continuous heavy rainfall.
Floods become dangerous when some construction is carried out ignoring human activities, drainage pattern,
slope of the land etc., and damage lives and property on a large scale.

What to do:

@ Collect your precious and personal requirements and take refuge at a safer place.

e@ Put water, dry breakfast, candles, lanterns, matchbox in a plastic box so that they do not get wet,

and they should be kept with you.

e@ Do not keep the children hungry.

e After the flood receeds, drink only boiled water.

@ Radio, Mobile phone should be kept with you invariably.

e@ Be aware of snakes. They may come to dry places. Keep a bamboo stick to drive them away.

What not to do:

@ Do not eat food prepared in flood water.

e@ Donot move out without collecting authentic information about the routes and situations before moving

to a safer place.

Cyclone : Due to atmospheric disturbances, a sudden strike is made by severe storms. These storms
are known as Cyclone in Indian sub-continent, Hurricane and Tornedo in USA, as Typhoon along the coasts
of china and Japan. These severe atmospheric storms are created due to unequal atmospheric pressure.
Such storms, or cyclones, create devastation over the area over which they pass. Its devastating effects
are felt along the coasts of eastern India and Kachchh-Saurashtra.

What to do :

@ Keep viewing the news bulletins on TV - Radio to know the anticipated time of the on-coming storms.

e@ Those who have a radio should keep an extra battery ready.

@ Mobile phone should be kept fully charged in advance. If you have a powerback instrument, it should
also be charged fully in advance.

Listen carefully to the instructions, warnings, broadcast over radio and implement them.
Stay away from rumours.
Store additional food, dry breakfast and drinking water as per need.

Keep provision of food and medicines, necessary for children and old people.
If the rescue team tells you to vacate your home, cooperated with them.

Use pure and safe drinking water.

e If you have taken shelter in a shelterhome, created by the Government or any NGO, then follow
their instructions and do not leave the premises without their instructions.

e Do not keep your domesticated animals tied up to their posts. If they are free, they can defend
themselves in a better way.

What not to do :

e Do not pay any attention to gossips or rumours, except for the instructions issued by the Weather
Department on Radio.

e If the atmosphere calms down suddenly, rain stops, wind becomes stand still, even then do not go
in open area. Wind or rainfall, may strike suddenly.

e Do not touch electric poles or loose wires, stay away from them.

e Do not take shelter near bigger hoardings or large trees.

Earthquake : An earthquake in general means the shaking of the surface of the earth. Due to tectonic

activities in the interior of the earth, an earthquake is felt. Its major areas are the regions with weaker relief
on the surface of the earth. Probable earthquake regions can be identified, but an earthquake can not be

forecast. Thus, much damage is caused in the absence of a forecast.

What to do:

e During an earthquake, stay beneath a large bench or a table.

e If you are in a school, sit beneath a bench.

e If you are in an open space, stay away from buildings, balcony, electric power lines and electric

poles.

e If you are driving a vehicle, then bring your vehicle to a halt over or below a bridge, keep away

from electric poles, power lines and traffic signals.

@ Remain seated in your vehicle till the earthquake tremours are not over.

e Even after the earthquake tremours are over, few things like fridge, photographs on the wall, ceiling

fans etc. may fall down afterwards, so keep away from them.

e For instructions or guidence about the event, listen to the local radio.

e New buildings under construction should be made earthquake proof.

What not to do :

e@ Do not shout or flee in panic.

e Do not attempt to prevent the things falling down after the earthquake tremours.

e Do not use elevators to go down.

e If you are in a house, do not stand near wooden cabinets (cupboard), safes, mirrors or a glass

chandelier.

e@ Do not light a match stick or a Lighter, or do not switch on electric gadgets before confirming that

the cooking gas is not leaking, because leaking gas may explode.

e Do not put a phone call unless for emergency medical help or fire. A prompt phone call may interrupt

telephone network which may obstruct the relief work.

Tsunami : The destructive and powerful sea waves are called Tsunami. These are generated at the
sea bottom due to earthquake having a rating of 7 or more on Richter scale, or by a volcanic eruption with
in sea or by a large scale land slide on ocean floors. Tsunami means 'destructing waves' in Japanese
language. Tsunami occurs mostly due to earthquakes on ocean floors, so these are also known as oceanic
earthquake waves. These waves travel very fast in circular pattern from the place of their origin. In deep
sea, these waves are not seen distinctly due to their shorter wave heights, but when they approach coasts
and shallow sea, they turn into devastating form. Its velocity reduces near coasts but height increases. So,
these waves surge ahead in the form of a wall near sea coast and cause devastation.

149 Disaster Management


--- PAGE 148 ---
More than 2 lakh people from Thailand, India, Indonesia, SriLanka and other South - Eastern countries
became victim of highly destructive Tsunami on 26" December, 2004.

With modern equipments a forecast and a nearly exact time of the striking of a tsunami can be predicted.
In future, more deaths can be prevented with due precautions.

What to do :

e With tsunami warning, move to a safer place away from sea coast.

@ Keep a radio handy and act according to the instructions received from the authorities.

e Construction of new buildings and societies should be carried out considering the tsunami impact.

e@ Mangrove reduces the overall impact of tsunami, so attempts should be made to expand their span.

What not to do :

e@ Do not take shelter on tall buildings, because these buildings may collapse due to destructive waves.

e After the tunami receeds, do not approach sea coast till the instructions are received from the authorities.

Drought : A drought is a highly destructive hazard, leaving a long lasting impact. It is connected with
water and food which are very much needed for the existence of living organisms. The problem of drought
occurs in regions of monsoon climate where the rainfall is irregular and is very scanty. This is so because
the agricultural crops, food grains and living organisms depend completely on water. The shortage is created
due to water crisis. Under such conditions, heavy damage is done to agriculture and natural vegetation. Earlier
many people died of starvation during a drought, but now it could be reduced due to transportation and
well planned management.

What to do:

e@ Drip irrigation in agriculture should be intensified.

e@ Food rationing and use of water should be planned after estimating their availability.

e Arrangement should be made for fair price distribution of food grains and relief work.

e@ Construction activity should be stopped except for the inevitable work.

What not to do :

e To prevent the food wastage, do not hold large scale dinner parties.

e@ Citizens should not hoard food grains or fodder.

Forest Fire : A forest fire is the fire which occurs in forests and creates devastation. Except for lightning,
all other reasons for a forest fire are man - induced. Among them, throwing of burnt butts of cigarettes - bidies,
or match sticks, burning things left by tourists, pilgrims or shepherds etc. are the major reasons. There are
more probabilities of a forest fire occuring during a dry season after autumn. At that time, the dry grass and
fallen tree leaves act as fuel. This situation is responsible for the spread of forest fire.

When both wind and inflammable fuel are dry, they form the basis of forest fire which spreads faster
during windy days of more temperature and less humidity. Some trees ooze out oily and inflammable material,
so the fire spreads faster.

Once the forest fire starts, it spreads in the directions of wind, advancing at a velocity of about 15
km per hour on all sides. Once it starts and if attempts are not made promptly to extinguish it, the forest
fire would stop only under two situations : (i) the forest fire is extinguished completely by itself, or (ii)
due to heavy rain.

Due to forest fire, smoke and spark, rising high with the warm air current, create a risk of fire among
the nearby settlements.

What to do :

e Act according to the instructions from Forest Department.

e Arrange special patrolling in forests during dry seasons.

e@ Employees of forest department should be trained for extinguishing forest fire.

Social Science, 9 (150)


--- PAGE 149 ---
What not to do :

@ While travelling through a forest, do not throw a burning bidi or other things.

e@ People living in settlements near the forest fire area, should not ignore the instructions from Forest

Department.

(2) Man-induced Disasters :

Those events which take place due to direct or indirect, knowingly or unknowingly done by men,
unawareness or ignorance and failure of human machinary etc. which cause heavy damage to human life
and property, are called man - induced Disasters.

Industrial Accidents : In industrial townships, mills, factories etc. there is a chance of accidents even
after enough precautions are taken. Such accidents result into deaths of people, live stock and damage to
property. Besides, the environment is also affected. Human errors are at the base of industrial accidents.
Men undertake the management and care of various machines of industrial processes, and collection, transfer
and distribution of the manufactored goods. At every stage, an accident cannot be ruled out.

Bhopal Gas Tragedy : Union Carbide, located at Bhopal which is the capital of Madhya Pradesh,
used to produce insecticides. In the process of producution a poisonous gas Mic was used. This gas was
stored in large tanks. In the early morning of 3"! December. 1984. this poisonous Mic gas started leaking
from the tanks, which lasted for about 40 minutes. Due to this event, which took place in early morning,
the gas very quickly spread over the densely populated area in Bhopal. According to official figures, about
2500 people died and thousands of residents in Bhopal were affected by this poisonous gas. Besides people,
the gas also killed thousands of birds and animals. Drinking water, reservoirs, land, unborn babies, new born
babies, pregnant women etc. were victims of its adverse effects. While 10,000 people became handicapped
permanently, 1.5 lakh people were handicapped partially.

Rescue Operations during Gas Leakage :

What to do :

Install modern warning system for getting advance information about gas leakage.

Pre-determine the high level measures for safety in factories and support it.

If the gas leaks during its transfer, the gas tanker should be driven away from human settlements.
Observe the wind direction and run into its opposite direction.

Do not treat breathlessness, burning eyes etc. by yourself, but seek medical guidance immediately.
Fainted or weak people should be immediately shifted from the affected area.

Inform fire Brigade and Police.

Park the vehicles in such a way that they do not obstruct the vehicles of Rescue operations.

What not to do :

e During Rescue Operations, persons who are not associated with the work should not gather around.

e Do not enter the affected area till the area under gas leakage is declared totally safe by the authorities.

e Do not join the rescue operation without proper training in rescue operations and necessary

equipments.

Viral Diseases : When a large number of people over much wider area become victim of any disease,
it is called epidemic. People lose their lives due to the disease. There is a faster increase in the number
of patients of viral diseases than the general diseases. Till to-day, thousands of people have been victims
of diseases like dengue, ebola, swineflu, influenza etc. These diseases are very much feared. In earlier times,
lakhs of people were victims of plague. However, such deadly diseases are controlled now with the help
of scientific inventions and anti-viral vaccines for safety. Along with it, with new viral diseases, and those
diseases which cannot be cured by traditional medicines, there is always a danger of widespread deaths
on mankind.

During the plague epidemic of Surat in September 1994, and recently swine flue and dengue epidemics,
many agencies took preventive steps to prevent deaths.

G31) Disaster Management


--- PAGE 150 ---
Safety Remedies for viral Diseases :

e An important step to be safe from viral diseases is to be vigilant about infection.

@ People should be acquainted with the reasons, results and safety about diseases through propaganda

and Transmissions.

@ Take the anti - disease vaccines.

e@ Arrange for a special separate ward for patients’ treatment.

e@ Take steps as per the guidelines and instructions, issued by World Health Organization (WHO), an

International Institution, to curb the viral diseases.

Terrorist Attacks : We all know that since last decade of the last century, the terrorist activity in
the entire world has become very much wicked. In reality, terrorism does not care for any race, community
or a region. It is the enemy of mankind. The immoral destructive acts performed by a person or a group
is called Terrorism. Inhuman acts like destruction of property, creating an atmosphere of fear and thereby
draw attention towards their demands, genocide, abduction etc. are terrorists’ weapons. Nowadays, the
terrorism has spread in many countries of the world. In recent times, no country is safe from terrorism.

Some Terrorist Acts of the World : On 9% September, 2001, a series of suicidal attacks were made
in U.S.A. by a terrorist organization. About 19 terrorists highjacked 4 passenger Jet planes of which 2 planes
were dashed against the Twin Towers in New York city. Due to this, all passengers on board and many
people working in these towers were killed within few minutes. Many people were injured as their houses
collapsed. Of the other two planes, one dashed with the Pentagon and the other dashed into a farm in
Pennsylvania. There was no survivor from these two planes. In this attack, about 3000 people were victimised
and more than 6000 were injured.

On 13 December, 2001, five terrorists from one terrorist organisation attacked the Indian Parliament
building and took the complex under its ban by firing without any restraint. Indian Army soldiers staked their
lives and defied the plan of nation's enemies to dissolute the Parliament, which is like a holy Temple of
Democracy. About 8 security guards became martyrs and 16 were wounded.

On the night of 26 November, 2008 a series of bomb blasts and firing took place near well known hotels
and some important places in Mumbai at a regular interval. About 137 persons were injured. In some well
known hotels, the terrorists kept many people under custody. The Central Government sent 200 NSG (National
Security Guards) Commandos, 50 military commandos and 5 battalions to control the situation. After two
day's of struggle, all the terrorists. equipped with modern armaments were killed.

In December 2014, about 141 persons, including 132 innocent students were killed in a terrorist attack
on an Army school, located in the cantonment area of Peshawar in Pakistan.

What to do:

e@ Inform the police about any doubtful behaviour of any person.

e@ Do not touch any unclaimed thing in public places, such as shopping malls, cinemas, gardens, religious
places etc.

Cooperate in security check for safety reasons.

If you rent your house, register it with the nearest police station. This is required under legal provisions.

Public places should be well equipped with CCTV cameras.

While travelling in a bus or train, if any person is noticed having left leaving his luggage behind, in

form the responsible authorities immediately.

e If your neighbour is single, does not mingle with local people, is working on computer till late night,
then inform the police about his/her behaviour.

e@ Inform Police about unclaimed vehicles.

What not to do:

e@ Do not accept any goods or parcel from any unknown person.

Social Science, 9 (132)


--- PAGE 151 ---
e Do not rent your house to an unknown person without thorough inquiry about him.

e@ Do not sell your home, mobile phone or a vehicle to any unknown person.

Riots : This problem is faced by many countries in the world. If we examine the general characteristics
of any riot, it is noticed that most of the persons are not aware of its root cause or purpose. Their presence
is only for crowding or for immitation. Such crowd which gathers without any common purpose or interest,
seems to disturb the peace intentionally. Such riots make the administrative set-up, which is established by
Law, unstable.

Sometimes when such riots take a political colour and turn into a revolt, or are transformed into a
communal riot, the social well-being and harmony are at risk. Innocent citizens have to suffer a lot due to
such riots. Life sustenance of labourers becomes very difficult. Moreover, a lot of life and property are
damaged.

It creates a challenge to maintain the unity and integrity of the nation.

What to do :

@ Prevent talks which spread rumours and violence.

e@ Form a peace committee in your residential area and be actively involved.

e@ Perform your civil duties by helping those affected by the riot.

What not to do :

e@ Do not be instrumental in spreading rumours.

e Do not violet the instructions or curfew declared by the authority to maintain Law and order.

e Do not believe and spread baseless talks appearing in social media.

Terrorists sometimes highjack a bus, train or a plane to get their demands met with for releasing their
accomplices from jail or for other demands. They bring pressure by taking the passengers into custody. In
such circumstances, the family members of the persons taken as hostages should maintain peace and support
the working of the Administration. In such instances, plans are implemented to relieve the citizen either by
commando operations or through the talks with the terrorists.

Traffic problems :

We have seen vehicles plying at a snail’s speed and very close to each other on the roads of large cities.
This situation is called Traffic Jam. When the means of transport come to a halt on the roads, the traffic
problems occur. Such a situation occurs freqvently on the busy roads of larger cities. The vehicular traffic
comes almost to a stand still during peak hours of commuting. At Such though times, the vehicle drivers, travel-
lers and pedestrians experience mental stress. It takes time to control the situation or to re-start the vehicular
traffic. Smoke from vehicles and other dirty things create air and noise pollution. This affacts the public hygiene
of that region and also the growth of vegetation.

Growing urbanization has created the traffic jam problems in almost all large cities. There is a long queue
of vehicles. When those vehicles which undertake relief work and rescue operations are stranded over the road,
people lose their life, e.g. stranding of 108 ambulence.

Increase in traffic, negligence of drivers and due to the ignorance in understanding the signs and symbols
put along the road, cause many accidents every year and many people lose their lives. Death-rate in India is very
high due to the accidents on the roads. Some times, a victim of an accident may become invalid permanently.

Incidences occur in newspaper frequently about the accidents caused by minors driving a vehicle. On the
highways, big disasters are caused due to heavy vehicular traffic and uncontrolled speedy vehicles. Accidents
occur at unmanned railway crossings are the result of undue haste or ignoring the in structions shown there.

Heavy traffic causes loss of time as well as fuel. If timely effective steps are not taken, advanced planning
for traffic management and dedication to observe them are not implemented, then it is going to create risks of
lives in the days to follow without and doubt.

What to do ?

e@ Develop suburban townships near larger cities and connect them intensely by facilitating public
transport systems.

G53) Disaster Management


--- PAGE 152 ---
@ Separate tracks should be prepared for pedestrians and cyclists.

Encroachments on the roads must be removed.

e@ Vehicles going at a very low speed or the vehicles pulled by men or by animals should be banned
during peak hours.

e Information regarding the traffic rules should be conveyed to the citizen through the educational
advertisements and public awareness programmes.

@ People going to their job place or business at the same place during same time should arrange for
‘car pool’ instread of going by individual separate vehicles.

e Digging and repairing work along the roads should be completed immediately.

e A tradition should be developed to take out the processions, marriage processions or religious
processions during lean period (hours) in stead of peak hours of vehicular traffic.

e@ At the time of traffice jam, keep your vehicle in proper lane.

e In frastructure like express high ways, overbridges, flyovers, ring roads and by pass roads should
be developed.

@ Every person, going for the job, should invariably use public transport at least once a week.

Use seat belts while driving a car.

@ Provision of heavy penalty should be made for the drivers who are drunk, who do not have their
driving licence, who drive recklessly and for those who violate traffic rules.
What not to do ?
e@ Do not violate the traffic rules.

Very old vehicles should not be used.

Transportation of goods should not be carried out except for night time and early morning.

Do not deface the instruction boards, signs or symbols on the roads. These are meant for vehicle

drivers.

Do not alter the design of the vehicle.

Do not use cell phones (mobiles) white driving.

Do not drive a vehicle without putting on the seat belt or the helmet.

A wayfarer crossing rails or road should not use ear phones or cell phones (mobiles).

Do not enter into arguments with persons who control the traffic regarding their instructions.

Guardians should not allow their minor children to drive vehicals. It is prohibited by Law.

Do not join a mob and obstruct the relief and safety work at the place of an accident due to your

inquisitiveness.

Impact of Disasters on Human Life :

Disasters affect almost every body, but its maximum ill effects are felt by the poor and under privileged
people. The effects of disasters can be grouped into four categories, as under.

Effects on Relief : There is a heavy damage or a total loss of movable and immovable property.
Infrastructural facilities like roads, railways, bridge, electricity, gas, telecommunication facilities etc. are
heavily damaged and cannot be restored immediately. Loss of ferlile agricultural land due to floods is also
a loss which cannot be compensated even after a prolonged time.

Effects on Human Life : Many people either die due to a disaster or become permanently handicapped.
Health of common citizen deteriorates. Those who loose their relatives are in intense trauma or desperate.
It is difficult to bring them out of the trauma. Situation of many orphan children and elderly people becomes
very awkward when their support is lost. Their rehabilitation needs very intense efforts. People have to face
many difficulties in life.

Effects on Economy : A huge capital has to be created for rehabilitation work after a disaster. It
affects the routine developmental work. Due to shortage of capital, the completion of projects is delayed.
A problem of unemployment emerges till the industrial units are re-activated. Economy of disaster affected
area becomes weaker.

Social Effects of Disasters : Migration or fleeing away by people affects the social structure of the
area affected by disaster. Social festivals and public celebrations become uninteresting compared to earlier
time. It takes many years to restore the original charm. Social organizations become weaker due to the
changes in social network.

Rehabilitation after the Disaster :

At the time of a disaster, first comes the rescue operation, followed by compensation or relief and lastly
the rehabilitation, which differs according to disasters. Many buildings have to be re-constructed after an
earthquake, flood or a cyclone. New employment has to be created after drought, and provision for farm
implements has to be made in agricultural field. After viral epidemics, programmes of mass education and
public awareness have to be arranged for safety in future. Rehabilitation work has to be carried out under
many obstacles since infrastructural facilities are damaged. It is difficult to rehabilitate a family where there
is one or two survivors. If the services of a psychiatrist is not provided timely to persons under trauma after
witnessing a disaster, it may bring adverse results. Training and employment are necessary to those survivors
who become handicapped permanently.

Thus, the rehabilitation work after a disaster is a very challenging one. It can be fulfilled only through
proper planning, implemented step by step.
