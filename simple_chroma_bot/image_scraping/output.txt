Origin and growth

In 1996 Jimmy Wales, a successful bond trader, moved to San Diego, to establish Bomis, Inc., a web portal
company. In March 2000 Wales founded Nupedia, a free online encyclopedia, with Larry Sanger as editor in
chief. Nupedia was organized like existing encyclopedias, with an advisory board of experts and a lengthy
review process. By January 2001 fewer than two dozen articles were finished, and Sanger advocated
supplementing Nupedia with an open-source encyclopedia based on wiki software. On January 15, 2001,
Wikipedia was launched as a feature of Nupedia.com, but, following objections from the advisory board, it
was relaunched as an independent website a few days later. In its first year Wikipedia expanded to some

20,000 articles in 18 languages, including French, German, Polish, Dutch, Hebrew, Chinese, and Esperanto.
In 2003 Nupedia was terminated and its articles moved into Wikipedia.

By 2006 the English-language version of Wikipedia had more than 1,000,000 articles, and by the time of its
1oth anniversary in 2011 it had surpassed 3,500,000. However, while the encyclopedia continued to expand
at arate of millions of words per month, the number of new articles created each year gradually decreased,
from a peak of 665,000 in 2007 to 374,000 in 2010. In response to this slowdown, the Wikimedia
Foundation began to focus its expansion efforts on non-English versions of Wikipedia, which by 2011
numbered more than 250. Some versions had already amassed hundreds of thousands of articles; indeed, the
French and German versions both boasted more than a million. Consequently, the foundation paid particular
attention to languages of the developing world, such as Swahili and Tamil, in an attempt to reach populations
otherwise underserved by the Internet. One impediment to Wikipedia’s ability to reach a truly global
audience, however, was the Chinese government's periodic restrictions of access to some or all of the site’s
content within China.
